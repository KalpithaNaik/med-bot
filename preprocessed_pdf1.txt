cardiovascular dis ease remains the leading cause of death in the united states there are greater than million myocardial infarcts per year furthermore the incidence of atrial ﬁ brillation and of heart failure is rising in part due to increased survival following acute coronary events to our aging popu lation and to other undetermined factors management of cardiovascu lar disease spans a wide range from acute care of the hemodynamically unstable patient interventions directed at acute coronary obstructions and electrically unstable rhythms to disease prevention and care of the chronically ill in an era of genomewide scans and growing lists of cardio vascular disease genes we still require a careful and detailed understand ing of disease pathophysiology and management in this handbook we attempt to represent this wide range of cardio vascular disease we are fortunate to practice in this era of evidence based medicine in which care algorithms are developed and therapeutic approaches are carefully deﬁ ned the chapters of this handbook provide the pathophysiological basis for many of these approaches followed by delineation of management although these chapters will not replace the timedependent accumulation of experience in clinical care we hope that this handbook provides easy and rapid access to many major daytoday management approaches to patients with cardiovascular problems we hope it will appeal to a broad range of clinicians in many settings includ ing the coronary care unit interventional laboratories emergency depart ments and medicine units both inpatient and outpatient it is designed to be a rapid reference guide for practicing cardiologists internists and relevant trainees there should still be sufﬁ cient space in white coat pockets for a hand book such as this one it is our hope that pearls of cardiovascular care will be easily removed from these white pockets and extracted from our handbook of cardiology viii acknowledgments we the four editors of the oxford american handbook of cardiology would like to express our gratitude to all contributors this includes the chap ter authors who are all members of the yale university cardiovascular medicine division either junior faculty or senior fellows they carefully have reviewed the most recent data and recommendations for cardiovas cular care incorporating the latest large clinical trials and published rec ommendations of our largest cardiovascular organizations the american heart association and the american college of cardiology thus this represents the most uptodate guidelines and recommendations we also acknowledge all involved at oxford university press most notably andrea seils senior editor of clinical medicine we are particu larly grateful for andreas patience as the coordination of this handbook production took longer than expected most importantly we want to formally and emphatically display our gratitude to professors ramrakha hill and all the authors of the original uk version of the oxford handbook of cardiology they all did extraordin ary work assembling the original handbook much of that work has been retained in the us version as noted we have attempted to incorpor ate us guidelines and recently published data into the new handbook however many of the original chapters remain stateoftheart and required very little editing or conversion the work done by the uk authors was more than the foundation for the us version if approval and commendations are forthcoming as we hope they are these must be directed to both the uk and

resuscitation follow ing a cardiorespiratory arrest the aim is to maintain adequate ventilation and circulation until the underlying cause for the arrest can be reversed a period of minutes without adequate perfusion less if the patient is hypoxic will lead to irreversible cerebral damage occasionally you will be the ﬁ rst to discover the unresponsive patient and it is important to rapidly assess the patient and begin cardiopulmon ary resuscitation cpr the various stages in bls are described here and summarized in figure figure stages in basic life support for further information see

ngertips under the point of the chin tilt the head up if this fails place your ﬁ ngers behind the angles of the lower jaw and apply steady pressure upward and forward remove illﬁ tting dentures and any obvious obstruction if the patient starts breathing roll patient over into the recovery position and try to keep the airway open until an orophyrangeal airway can be inserted use jaw thrust without head extension if trauma is suspected see fig figure opening the airway reproduced with permission from ramrakha ps moore kpk oxford handbook of acute medicine oxford uk oxford university press jaw lift to open the airway jaw thrust thrust the angle of the mandible upward chapter cardiovascular emergencies keep the airway open look listen and feel for breathing look for chest movements listen at the victims mouth for breathing sounds and feel for air on your cheek for no more than seconds if the patient is breathing turn patient into the recovery position check for continued breathing and get help if the patient is not breathing or is making occasional gasps or weak attempts at breathing send someone or go for help if alone on return start rescue breaths by giving two slow effective breaths each resulting in a visible rise and fall in the chest wall a mouthto barrier device may be used assessment of circulation assess signs of circulation by feeling the carotid pulse for no more than seconds if there are signs of circulation but no breathing continue rescue breaths and check for signs of breathing every breaths if there are no signs of circulation start chest compression combine rescue breaths and compression at the rate of compressions to two effective breaths repeating this cycle times in approximately minutes the ratio of compressions to lung inﬂ ation remains the same for resuscitation with two persons adult advanced life support adult advanced life support it is unlikely that an effective spontaneous cardiac activity will be restored by bls without more advanced techniques intubation for effective ventilation drugs deﬁ brillation etc do not waste time as soon as help arrives delegate cpr to someone less experienced in advanced cardiac life support acls so that you are able to continue attach the patient to an automated external deﬁ brillator aed as soon as possible to determine if there is a shockable rhythm and treat appropriately see p for the universal treatment algorithm oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways help maintain the patency of the airway by keeping the tongue out of the way see fig endotracheal et intubation is the best method of securing the airway do not attempt this if you are inexperienced establish venous access central vein cannulation internal jugular or subclavian is ideal but requires more training and practice and is not for the inexperienced if venous access fails drugs may be given via an intraosseous io route more effective than an et tube or et tube into the lungs except for bicarbonate and calcium salts double the dose of drug if using this route as absorption is less efﬁ cient than when given intravenously iv post resuscitation care try to establish the events that precipitated the arrest from the history staff witnesses and hospital notes of the patient is there an obvious cause myocardial infarction mi hypoxia hypoglycemia stroke drug overdose or interaction electrolyte abnormality etc record the duration of the arrest in the notes with the interventions drugs and doses in chronological order examine the patient to check that both lung ﬁ elds are being ventilated check for ribs that may have broken during cpr listen for any cardiac murmurs check the neck veins examine the abdomen for an aneurysm or signs of peritoneal irritation insert urinary catheter consider a nasogastric ng tube if the patient remains unconscious record the glasgow coma score and perform a brief neurological assessment investigations ecg electrocardiogram looking for mi ischemia tall twaves suggesting hyperkalemia abg arterial blood gas mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis is common and usually responds to adequate oxygenation and ventilation once the circulation is restored cxr chest xray check position of et tube look for pneumothorax and glucose cbc complete blood count after early and successful resuscitation from a primary cardiac arrest the patient may rapidly recover completely the patient must be transferred to an appropriate location icu for monitoring and treatment change any venous lines that were inserted at the time of arrest for central lines inserted with sterile technique insert an arterial line and consider pulmonary artery pa catheter swanganz if requiring inotropes chapter cardiovascular emergencies remember to talk to the relatives keep them informed of events and give a realistic picture of the arrest and possible outcomes when appropriate consider the possibility of organ donation and do not be frightened to discuss this with the relatives even if discussion with the relatives is delayed remember that corneas and heart valves may be used up to hours after death consider hypothermia for patients who do not

oxford university press insertion of nasopharyngeal airway insertion of oropharyngeal airway universal treatment algorithm universal treatment algorithm cardiac rhythms of cardiac arrest can be divided into two groups ventricular ﬁ brillationpulseless ventricular tachycardia vfvt other cardiac rhythms which include asystole and pulseless elec trical activity pea the principle difference in treatment of the two groups of arrhythmias is the need for attempted deﬁ brillation in the vfvt group of patients figure summarizes the algorithm for management of both groups of patients vfvt vfvt are the most common rhythms at the time of cardiac arrest success in treatment of vfvt is dependent on the delivery of prompt deﬁ brillation with each minute the chances of successful deﬁ brillation declines by chest compressions and ventilation should be undertaken until the monitor and deﬁ brillator are available typically j to j for a biphasic deﬁ brillator and j for a monophasic deﬁ brillator is delivered in one shock continue cpr x cycles then reassess if there is persistent vfvt a second shock is delivered biphasic at an energy speciﬁ c to the device and monophasic at j at this time epinephrine mg ivio or vasopressin u ivio can be given and repeated next another shock is delivered and if there is persistent vfvt then antiarrhythmics amiodarone mg ivio once then mg ivio once or lidocaine mgkg ﬁ rst dose and then mgkg ivio for a maximum of mgkg should be considered after each shock cpr is resumed immediately for cycles after which the carotid pulse should be palpated only if the waveform changes to one usually capable of providing a cardiac output shock cycle is repeated every minute if vfvt persists myocardial and cerebral viability must be maintained after each shock cycle with chest compressions and ventilation in between cycles of deﬁ brillation reversible factors must be identiﬁ ed and corrected the patient intubated if possible and venous access obtained nonvfvt rhythms the outcome from these rhythms is generally worse than that with vfvt unless a reversible cause can be identiﬁ ed and treated promptly chest compressions and ventilation should be undertaken for minutes with each loop of the algorithm minute if directly after a shock with each cycle attempts must be made to intubate the patient gain iv access and give adrenaline asystole atropine mg iv should be given to block all vagal output in the presence of p waves on the ecg stripmonitor pacing external or transvenous must be considered chapter cardiovascular emergencies pulseless electrical activity pea identiﬁ cation of the underlying cause and its correction are both vital for successful resuscitation resuscitation must be continued while reversible causes are

as there are many acute bends to negotiate and a stable position is difﬁ cult to achieve avoid the left subclavicular area as this is the preferred area for permanent pacemaker insertion and should be kept virgin if possible the femoral vein may be used incidence of dvt and infection is high insert a sheath similar to that for pa catheterization through which the pacing wire can be fed pacing wires are commonly f or f and a sheath at least one size larger is necessary most commercially available pacing wires are prepacked with an introducer needle and plastic cannula similar to an abbocath which may be used to position the pacing wire however the cannula does not have a hemostatic seal the plastic cannula may be removed from the vein leaving the bare wire entering the skin once a stable position has been achieved this reduces the risk of wire displacement but also makes repositioning of the wire more difﬁ cult should this be necessary and infection risk is higher pass the wire through the sterile plastic cover that accompanies the introducer sheath and advance into the upper right atrium see fig but do not unfurl the cover yet the wire is much easier to manipulate with gloved hands without the hindrance of the plastic cover advance the wire with the tip pointing toward the right ventricle it may cross the tricuspid valve easily if it fails to cross point the tip to the lateral wall of the atrium and form a loop rotate the wire and the loop should fall across the tricuspid valve into the ventricle advance and rotate the wire so that the tip points inferiorly as

with normal coronary arteries alternatively these conditions may coexist and be exacerbated by emotional stress history and examination angina pectoris is characterized by a deep and diffusely distributed cen tral chest discomfort certain features of pain are of discriminative value patients will not be able to point to where the pain is coming from with one ﬁ nger but will use an open palm or ﬁ st over the center or left para sternal aspect of their chest the pain is not sharp some patients confuse sharp with severe pain lasts longer than a few seconds and rarely exceeds an hour without varying in severity most episodes will last minutes the response to nitroglycerin if any will be almost immediate generally responses taking more than minutes are unlikely to be related to the drug chest wall tenderness suggests musculoskeletal pain and does not accom pany angina dyspnea fatigue nausea and recurrent belching may also represent underlying ischemia and can occur in the absence of the classical central chest pain the clue to underlying ischemic heart disease ihd lies in their precipitation by exertion or emotional stress angina is often classiﬁ ed according to its temporal pattern and its rela tion to exertion because this loosely reﬂ ects prognosis stable angina is characterized by pain occurring after a relatively constant level of exertion unstable angina is characterized by pain on minor exertion or at rest which is either new onset or a dramatic worsening of existing angina also it can present as pain on everdiminishing levels of exertion usually over a period of days the canadian cardiovascular society ccs system provides a quantitative means to describe exertional capacity and is divided into four classes i minimal limitation of ordinary activity angina occurs with strenuous rapid or prolonged exertion at work or recreation ii slight limitation of ordinary activity angina occurs on walking or climb ing stairs rapidly walking in cold in wind or under emotional stress iii marked limitation of ordinary physical activity angina occurs on walking m on level ground or climbing ﬂ ight of stairs at a normal pace in normal conditions iv inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort angina symptoms may be present at rest angina pectoris physical examination measure the pulse rate this may be slowed by inferior ischemia due to

postexercise abis at minute intervals for minutes after exercise this is particularly useful in patients who have normal resting abis and typical symptoms of claudication in addition treadmill testing

anticoagulation with warfarin is not recommended as it is not more effective than antiplatelet therapy and has more bleeding complications pharmacotherapy vasodilator therapy has not demonstrated efﬁ

stenoses can result from technical errors made during surgery such as retained valve cuffs intimal ﬂ ap or valvotome injury fibrous intimal hyperplasia can result usually within months from surgery finally ath erosclerosis can develop this usually results years from surgery graft surveillance programs in which color duplex ultrasonography is per formed at regular intervals have enabled the early evaluation of graft sten osis this allows for early graft revision and avoids graft failure antiplatelet and coumarin datives also increase graft patency rates chapter peripheral vascular disease

development cardiac valves develop from the mesodermal germ layer between the fourth and seventh weeks of gestation factors affecting embryogen esis during this time can inﬂ uence valve development such as infection rubella or drugs anatomy the human heart contains four valves two on the left side of the heart mitral and aortic and two on the right tricuspid and pulmonic or pul monary fig the mitral and tricuspid valves also referred to as atrioventricular av valves are supported by a ﬁ brous skeleton and separate the atrial and ventricular chambers ensuring unidirectional ﬂ ow of blood during dias tole the mitral valve is composed of two leaﬂ ets anterior and poste rior while the tricuspid valve as the name implies contains three leaﬂ ets anterior posterior and septal both the mitral and tricuspid valve leaﬂ ets are attached by chordae tendinae to papillary muscles in their respective ventricles the contrac tion of which ensures valve competency the aortic and pulmonic valves also referred to as semilunar valves separate the left and right ventricles from the aorta and pulmonary artery respectively ensuring unidirectional forward blood ﬂ ow during systole the aortic

and subvalvular apparatus in the absence of any recognizable systemic connective tissue disorder it can be inherited as an autosomal dominant phenotype with incomplete penetrance secondary mvp occurs in the setting of known connective tissue dis orders including marfans syndrome ehlersdanlos syndrome pseudox anthoma elasticum and osteogenesis imperfecta mvp is also frequently associated with atrial septal defects and ebsteins anomaly one can also see acquired leaﬂ et prolapse ie functional mvp in ischemic heart dis ease and dilated cardiomyopathy overall prevalence is approximately and is similar in men and women pathophysiology myxomatous degeneration and excess mucopolysaccharide accumulation lead to large ﬂ oppy valve leaﬂ ets prolapse can be caused by papillary muscle dysfunction elongated or ruptured chordae tendinae a dilated mitral annulus andor redundant leaﬂ ets mv leaﬂ et usually posterior prolapses into the la during ventricular systole mitral regurgitation results from

failure introduction deﬁ nition heart failure hf is a progressive condition with several stages as outlined by the accaha task force stages ad see fig heart failure can be deﬁ ned as a clinical syndrome that results from any structural or func tional abnormality of the heart that impairs the ability of the left ventricle to ﬁ ll with or to eject blood it is characterized by dyspnea andor fatigue on exertion and occasionally at rest and evidence of ﬂ uid retention that may lead to peripheral edema or pulmonary congestion a clinical response to treatment directed at heart failure alone eg diuretic use is not sufﬁ cient for diagnosis epidemiology and prognosis the development of new therapeutic innovations for coronary artery disease coupled with an aging population has led to an increase in the prevalence of heart failure there are currently over million cases in the united states and an estimated million people with heart failure world wide nearly one million new cases are diagnosed annually worldwide the lifetime risk of developing heart failure for all comers over the age of is the prevalence increases with age with the mean age of the heart failure population being in their mids despite improvement in prognosis in coronary artery disease the prog nosis in heart failure remains poor with over of all patients hospital ized for the ﬁ rst time with heart failure dying within years patients with heart failure can die suddenly as the result of ventricu lar tachyarrhythmias or with worsening heart failure symptoms and ﬂ uid overload pathophysiology the origin of symptoms in heart failure is poorly understood an initial event infarction inﬂ ammation pressurevolume overload causes myo cardial damage resulting in an increase in myocardial wall stress this is fol lowed by the activation of multiple neuroendocrine systems including the reninangiotensinaldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system and the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor tnf neuroendocrine activation is also accompanied by structural and metabolic changes in the peripheral skeletal muscle and by abnormalities in cardiopulmonary reﬂ ex function such as the baroreﬂ ex and chemore ﬂ ex these produce further wall stress perpetuating this vicious cycle see fig introduction figure stages of heart failure acei angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor arb angiotensin

manifestations depend on the speed with which the syndrome develops acute heart failure is often used to describe the patient with acuteonset dyspnea and pulmonary edema but it can also apply to cardio genic shock where the patient is hypotensive and oliguric compensatory mechanisms have not yet become operative acute deterioration may be a consequence of myocardial infarction mi arrhythmia or acute valve dysfunction eg endocarditis systolic vs diastolic heart failure most patients with heart failure have impaired lv systolic function there is a failure of the lv to eject blood however there is a group of patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure but apparently preserved lv systolic function these patients are said to have diastolic heart failure there is an abnormality in the ability of the lv to ﬁ ll in diastole this may be transient eg acute ischemia or persistent restrictive or inﬁ ltrative cardiomyopathy or lvh right vs left heart failure right and left heart failure refers to whether the patient has either pre dominantly systemic venous congestion swollen ankles hepatome galy or pulmonary venous congestion pulmonary edema respectively these terms do not necessarily indicate which ventricle is most seriously affected fluid retention in heart failure is due to a combination of factors reduced gfr glomerular ﬁ ltration rate and activation of the reninangiotensin aldosterone system and sympathetic system however there are causes for swollen ankles other than heart failure gravitational disorder eg immo bility venous thrombosis or obstruction varicose veins hypoproteinemia eg nephrotic syndrome or liver disease or lymphatic obstruction see also box highoutput vs lowoutput heart failure a variety of highoutput states may lead to heart failure eg thyrotoxico sis pagets disease beriberi and anemia highoutput failure is character ized by warm extremities and normal or widened pulse pressure in contrast lowoutput states are characterized by cool pale extremi ties cyanosis due to systemic vasoconstriction and low pulse volume the mixed venous oxygen saturation a marker of the ability of the heart to deliver oxygen to the metabolizing tissues is typically abnormally low in lowoutput states but normal or even high in highoutput states chapter heart failure box conditions mimicking heart failure obesity chest disease

causes and precipitants in all patients with heart failure it is important to carefully consider the underlying etiology as there may be speciﬁ c exacerbating factors or other diseases that inﬂ uence the patients management a nonexhaustive list is given in box patients with compensated heart failure have a high rate of readmission to hospital with acute exacerbations a number of studies have demon strated that a precipitating cause for emergency admission to the hospital with heart failure can be identiﬁ ed in up to twothirds of patients inappropriate reduction in therapy selfdiscontinuation or iatrogenic withdrawal of diuretics acei digoxin and dietary excess of salt are recognized precipitants education of the patient and family is important cardiac arrhythmias most commonly af but any tachyarrhythmia will further reduce lv ﬁ lling and stroke volume and may exacerbate ischemia marked bradycardia reduces cardiac output especially if stroke volume cannot increase any further myocardial ischemia or infarction exacerbates lv dysfunction and may worsen mitral regurgitation due to ischemia of papillary muscles infection respiratory infections are a common precipitant but any systemic infection can precipitate heart failure through a combination of factors including direct myocardial depression from inﬂ ammatory cytokines sinus tachycardia and fever anemia this causes a highoutput state that may precipitate acute heart failure and may exacerbate underlying ischemia concomitant drug therapy drugs that directly depress myocardial function eg calcium antagonistsverapamil diltiazem many antiarrhythmics anesthetics overenthusiastic initiation of bblockers etc as well as drugs causing salt and water retention eg nsaids estrogens steroids cox antagonists may precipitate heart failure alcohol this is directly toxic and in excess can depress myocardial function and predispose to arrhythmias pulmonary embolism the risk increases in the

general rule nsaids are avoided because of their ﬂ uid retaining and renotoxic properties it is also thought that the beneﬁ cial effect of ace inhibitors is reduced by these drugs generally patients

but with preserved normal lv systolic function a number of clinical settings are associated with diastolic dysfunction most causes of diastolic dysfunction relate to impaired left ventricular diastolic relaxation the most common underlying diseases are hyperten sion and ischemia as a result of coronary artery disease other causes include aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and inﬁ ltrative such as in cardiac amyloidosis and restrictive cardiomyopathies pericardial restraint such as in constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tam ponade impairs ventricular ﬁ lling in addition mitral valve stenosis causing left ventricular outﬂ ow obstruction leads to elevated left atrial pressure and in severe cases cardiac failure that is solely due to impaired ﬁ lling pathophysiology ventricular relaxation may be impaired this is an energydependent pro cess and is sensitive to hypoxia myocardial ischemia can induce diastolic dysfunction via this mechanism ischemia may be caused not only by epi cardial coronary artery disease but possibly also by changes in the micro vascular coronary supply increased compliance of the left ventricle leads to a stiff chamber and impaired ﬁ lling there is evidence that this altered compliance is mediated by an increase in myocardial collagen most conditions causing left ventricular hypertrophy are associated with impairment of diastolic function however in conditions where myocardial hypertrophy is not associated with ﬁ brosis such as chronic anemia hyper thyroidism and exercise training diastolic stiffness is normal clinical assessment clinical features of hf may be similar regardless of whether lv systo lic function is impaired or preserved the clinical presentation should be considered along with assessment of systolic

volumes and contractility noninvasive methods eg doppler echocardiography have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction but these tests have signiﬁ cant limitations because

while great strides have been made over the past several decades in the management of symptomatic ischemic heart disease with dramatic improvements in outcomes from acute coronary syndromes the identiﬁ cation and modiﬁ cation of atherosclerotic risk factors has also contributed signiﬁ cantly to overall public health the ﬁ eld of preventive cardiology focuses on the management of car diovascular disease risk factors in order to prevent disease occurrence and reduce the incidence of subsequent clinical events in those with estab lished cardiovascular disease primary prevention involves controlling risk in order to prevent disease while secondary prevention strategies focus on early disease detection and interventions to limit progression of disease in this chapter the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis will be reviewed which provides the basis for understanding risk factors and how to man age them atherosclerosis pathophysiology atherosclerosis pathophysiology atherosclerosis is a disease of the large and mediumsized arteries char acterized by a gradual buildup of fatty plaques within the arterial wall this may eventually result in a signiﬁ cant narrowing of the vessel lumen impairing blood ﬂ ow these plaques may also become unstable and thrombose leading to an acute coronary syndrome pathophysiology the atherogenic process is characterized by dysfunction of the endothelial lining of the vessel associated with inﬂ ammation of the vascular wall this leads to the buildup of lipids inﬂ ammatory cells and cellular debris within the intima and subintimal layers of the vessel resulting in plaque formation and remodeling of the arterial wall this process is complex involving a series of interactions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells leukocytes and platelets in the vas cular wall endothelial dysfunction the atherosclerotic process appears to be triggered by endothelial cell injury from exposure to stimuli such as tobacco toxins oxidized lowden sity lipoprotein ldl advanced glycation end products elevated homo cysteine or infectious agents this initiates a cascade of events resulting in cellular dysfunction see fig the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction is a change in the balance of production of endotheliumderived vasoactive molecules there is a reduced bioavailability of endothelial nitric oxide no which possesses important vasodilator antithrombotic and antiproliferative properties in parallel with increased generation of the potent vasoconstrictor agents endothelin and angiotensinii which also promote cell migration and growth dysfunctional endothelial cells also express adhesion molecules and secrete chemokines promoting cell migration and adhesion levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor and tissue factor are increased tissue plasminogen activator and thrombomodulin are reduced and low no release results in increased platelet activation and adhesion chapter preventive cardiology

decreased no production reactive oxygen species hypertension type diabetes mellitus smoking development of atherosclerotic plaques development of atherosclerotic plaques endothelial dysfunction creates a local milieu that facilitates initiation and development of the atherosclerotic plaque see fig circulating leu kocytes predominantly monocytes are attracted and bind to activated endothelial cells and migrate into the subendothelial layer where they transform into macrophages here they act as local scavenger cells tak ing up modiﬁ ed ldl cholesterol ultimately becoming the characteristic foam cells of established atherosclerosis the earliest lesions are known as fatty streaks which consist predomi nantly of lipids and foam cells these lesions may develop into ﬁ brous plaques as a consequence of further lipid accumulation accompanied by local migration proliferation and ﬁ brous transformation of smooth mus cle cells these cells are responsible for the deposition of extracellular connective tissue matrix leading to formation of a ﬁ brous cap this cap overlies a central core consisting of foam cells extracellular lipid necrotic cellular debris and a mixture of other inﬂ ammatory cells including t lymphocytes this process is facilitated by ongoing endothelial dysfunction together with local generation of powerful mitogens such as plateletderived growth factor pdgf transforming growth factor b tgfb and insulin like growth factor igf from endothelial cells macrophages and activated platelets further growth of the plaque initially causes outward remodeling of the vessel wall thus minimizing the impact on the crosssectional area of the lumen however progressive plaque accumulation results in luminal nar rowing and ultimately vessel obstruction see fig plaque initiation and progression tend to occur more predictably at certain locations of the vascular system blood ﬂ ow through arteries causes local shear stress which inﬂ uences the biology of the underlying endothelium high laminar shear from blood ﬂ owing quickly through a straight vessel favors the generation of no which helps maintain the functional integrity of the vessel in contrast low shear or differential shear caused by turbulent ﬂ ow results in dysfunction of the underlying endothelium which facilitates ini tiation and progression of atherosclerosis this is a consequence of differ ential gene activation proﬁ les in response to laminar atheroprotective as opposed to turbulent atheroinducing blood ﬂ ow which may explain why plaques are more commonly found at sites of vessel branching or curvature these sites experience more dramatic and abrupt changes in blood ﬂ ow velocity these shear stressmediated effects are most marked in the coronary carotid renal and iliofemoral arteries in which the majority of clinically important atherosclerotic lesions develop the vulnerable plaque erosion of the endothelial layer or rupture of the overlying ﬁ brous cap may expose the highly thrombogenic lipidrich core of the plaque to cir culating blood collagen tissue factor and other factors activate platelets and trigger the coagulation cascade leading to acute thrombosis which chapter preventive cardiology may rapidly occlude the vessel myocardial infarction mi can result usu ally characterized by stsegment elevation coronary thrombosis is a dynamic process in vivo and may be reversed at least in part by activation of tissue plasminogen activator and proteins c and s of the intrinsic antithromboticﬁ brinolytic system acute subto tal occlusion of a coronary artery typically causes acute nonstsegment elevation mi stemi or unstable angina atheromatous plaques that have a thin ﬁ brous cap and a large necrotic lipid core and containing a high proportion of inﬂ ammatory cells and mediators are particularly predisposed to destabilization or rupture with consequent thrombosis conversely plaques with a smaller lipid pool thicker ﬁ brous caps and less inﬂ ammatory activity are more stable and less prone to rupture several studies have shown that well over half of all mis are caused by acute destabilization of plaques that were previously not ﬂ ow limiting ie stenosis suggesting that the likelihood of an acute coronary event is more closely related to the stability of the plaque rather than the severity of the stenosis figure cellular

coronary disease stroke and peripheral arterial disease is the leading cause of death in the united states account ing for more than deaths annually at age the lifetime risk of developing coronary disease is for men and for women although mortality rates have decreased by approximately over the past years the rate of decline has slowed since autopsy data have conﬁ rmed a decreased prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis in both men and women since the late s a substantial component of this reduction is the modiﬁ cation of risk factors particularly decreased smoking and better hypertension treatment a concerning trend in recent times is the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes particularly among younger people this trend may explain the declining mortality rate reduction from cardiovascular disease approximately million people in the united states have symptomatic coronary disease this number is likely an underestimation of the total population disease burden as many patients are asymptomatic or have silent or clinically unrecognized manifestations of disease much of our understanding of cardiovascular disease risk factors is derived from large epidemiologic studies including the framingham heart study and the nurses health study as we will discuss the important modiﬁ able risk factors for cardiovascu lar disease include smoking diet hypertension dyslipidemias physical inactiv ity obesity and diabetes it is important to recognize that many patients with cardiovascular disease have multiple risk factors each of which requires appropriate management for optimal risk reduction atherosclerosis is a systemic disease atherosclerosis in one vascular territory is often associated with disease elsewhere as the risk factors for coronary disease stroke and peripheral vascular disease are similar it is important to recognize this association as clinically evident disease in one vascular bed may be a harbinger of silent and potentially modiﬁ able disease in another particularly the coro nary arterial system cardiac events are the leading cause of mortality in patients with peripheral vascular disease for this reason cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease are considered coronary disease equivalents appropriate preventive strategies and goals should be applied in these patients chapter preventive cardiology assessment of atherosclerotic risk identiﬁ cation and treatment of risk factors is essential for the prevention of atherosclerotic disease in individuals and society when multiple risk factors such as dyslipidemia high blood pressure and smoking coexist as is commonly the case the cardiovascular risk is greatly increased suggest ing a synergistic interaction among these factors for example the absolute risk of a cardiovascular event occurring in a patient with high blood pressure is greatly inﬂ uenced by their age sex lipid proﬁ le presence of diabetes and other factors thus modern approaches to risk management should involve careful consideration of the combined impact of all important factors operating in the individual that contribute to their risk of atherosclerotic disease global risk assessment several risk assessment systems are currently available derived from large prospective population cohorts most commonly the framingham study tables these systems allow the calculation of the absolute risk of having a cardiovascular event ie the probability of having a heart attack or stroke within the next years which is derived from patients risk factor variables age sex cholesterol hdl bp smoking subjects with established coronary disease or stable angina have a year event rate of approximately therefore subjects without clinical disease that have a predicted year likelihood of suffering a car diovascular event of t are considered to be at high risk and are candi dates for aggressive risk factor management although these conventional scoring systems have the potential to iden tify most highrisk individuals in western populations a signiﬁ cant propor tion of events occur in subjects calculated to be at intermediate and low risk for example risk is typically underestimated when using conventional methods in young subjects with multiple risk factors subjects with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease and certain ethnic groups including individuals of south asian racial origin identiﬁ cation of subjects with intermediate conventional risk scores that are actually at high risk remains a major challenge as these individuals are also likely to beneﬁ t from aggressive preventive therapy it has been proposed that measurement of creactive protein crp levels ultrasound assessment of carotid artery intimamedial thickness and coronary artery calcium scoring with ct scanning may improve risk assessment especially in patients at intermediate risk based on traditional risk factor assessment these techniques are highly promising and under intense investigation but their clinical utility and cost have not yet been conﬁ rmed in large prospective clinical studies and they are not currently used in routine clinical practice however in selected asymptomatic patients at intermediate risk based on traditional scoring systems the use of these techniques may be appro priate if the results will alter the management strategy by reclassifying a patient as low or high risk likewise routine use of stress testing for coronary artery disease cad screening in asymptomatic subjects is also not currently recommended

the number of persons aged t years is expected to increase from approximately million in to an estimated million in and the number of persons aged t years is expected to increase from million in to

develops with increasing age for men the reported prevalence increases with age from at ages years to at years at years and at years the corresponding estimates for women are substantially lower than

menopause and is similar to that seen in men in the population over although less common the disease remains the leading cause of death in women for example the ageadjusted mortality rates from heart disease are four to six times higher than their mortality rates from breast cancer although cardiovascular risk factors promote disease in both genders the strength of the association differs for example diabetes and low high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol are stronger risk factors for women than for men female sex hormones probably contribute to the lower risk of athero sclerotic disease in premenopausal women additionally observational studies showed that the risk of ischemic heart disease is reduced by up to in women using hrt however hrt users are typically healthier than nonusers suggesting that these results could be explained by selec tion bias several large randomized controlled trials of hrt in postmenopausal women whi hershers ii esprit era with and without atheroscle rosis have suggested that hrt does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and in fact leads to a small but statistically signiﬁ cant increase in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease the age at entry into these trials has recently brought the broad implications of these data into question however hrt should not be recommended for primary or secondary prevention of

physical inactivity chapter preventive cardiology ethnic origin a difference in cardiovascular disease prevalence among various ethnic groups is likely explained by clustering of risk factors in these groups although a genetic component may be contributing as well between and the rate of coronary disease decreased in whites while the rates actually increased for blacks and hispanics differences in the delivery of health care as well as risk factors among these groups may explain this trend smoking smoking increases the risk of coronary disease by approximately with mortality from any cardiovascular disease around higher in smokers and higher in heavy smokers than in nonsmokers see fig in approximately of us adults of men of women were current smokers although the number of smokers has declined sub stantially over the past years this trend has slowed in the adolescent population where smoking prevalence has not declined since the incidence of an mi is increased sixfold in women and threefold in men who smoke at least cigarettes per day compared to subjects who never smoked secondhand smoke smoke that has been exhaled by a smoker also increases the risk of coronary disease by around smoking cessation carries almost immediate beneﬁ t and the longterm beneﬁ ts are greatest in those who stop smoking before the age of such that the survival curve overlaps with nonsmokers

obesity obesity signiﬁ cantly increases the risk of cad with of cases in developed countries attributable to increased body mass index bmi obesity is also associated with a number of other risk

if the waist circumference is inches in men and inches in women the prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly worldwide compared to nhanes data from to data from nhanes to dem onstrates an increase in the prevalence of overweight and obese adults from to for overweight and from to for obese adults of particular concern is the dramatic increase in prevalence of obesity in children a trend that is likely to exacerbate the problem in adulthood and undo many of the other recent improvements in cardiovascular health overweight and obese individuals also tend to be less physically active and consume unhealthy diets with excess calories which further contrib utes to their atherogenic risk dietary modiﬁ cation and exercise are thus the ﬁ rstline interventions in these individuals together with careful sur veillance for and aggressive management of other risk factors and compli cations of obesity when present bariatric surgery may have a role in selected patients especially if more conservative weight loss measures fail psychological stress the burden of risk attributable to psychological stress is difﬁ cult to quan tify however increased stress at work lack of social support hostile personality type anxiety and depression are consistently associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and acute coronary events the link between psychological stress and atherosclerosis may be both direct through endothelial damage and indirect via exacerbation of tradi tional risk factors such as smoking and hypertension inﬂ ammation inﬂ ammation is involved in the atherosclerotic process from plaque origi nation and progression to acute rupture and thrombosis this inﬂ amma tory process directly links known risk factors to the underlying mechanism of disease chapter preventive cardiology large studies have shown that lowgrade elevation of inﬂ ammatory markers most notably crp predicts outcomes from cardiovascular dis ease and may add to the prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors it has been suggested that a crp level below mgl is associ ated with low risk between and mgl reﬂ ects intermediate risk and a level above mgl is associated with a high longterm risk of vascular events certain treatments that reduce atherosclerotic risk particularly stat ins have antiinﬂ ammatory effects that may contribute to their clinical beneﬁ ts however the incremental value of crp as a marker of risk and target of therapy in global risk management remains a controversial topic that requires further investigation such as the recently completed jupiter trial which demonstrated improved outcomes with rosuvastatin in patients with elevated crp and normal lipids homocysteine the genetic disease homocystinuria is associated with aggressive prema ture atherosclerosis additionally strong epidemiological and mechanis tic evidence suggests that even modest increases in homocysteine levels promote atherosclerosis progression vascular inﬂ ammation and oxidative stress appear to be the responsible mechanisms dietary supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with vitamins b and b can reduce levels of homocysteine and improve aspects of vascular biology in vivo as well as in vitro however large randomized trials visp wenbit norvit hope of vitamin supplementation to lower homocysteine levels in patients with established cardiovascular dis ease have found no decrease in cardiovascular events or death therefore folate bb supplementation is not currently recommended for sec ondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease folate supplementation as primary prevention has yet to be examined in a large randomized trial so this use is also not currently recommended antioxidant vitamins despite excellent epidemiological and mechanistic evidence that increased oxidative stress is associated with vascular injury inﬂ ammation and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality large randomized controlled trials hope hps and gissip of vitamin a c and e supple mentation have shown no effect on cardiovascular outcomes in primary or secondary prevention currently antioxidant vitamin supplementation should not be routinely recommended for prevention of atherosclerotic disease dietary measures several dietary measures can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascu lar disease total fat intake should be reduced to below of total calories intake of saturated fat and foods high in trans fatty acids should be limited to total calories and replaced with monounsaturated fat canola and olive oil based on data from the nurses health study the risk of coronary heart disease would be reduced by if of energy from saturated fat were risk factors for coronary artery disease replaced by energy from unsaturated fats and by if of energy from trans fat was replaced by energy from unhydrogenated unsaturated fat recommended cholesterol intake is mgday dietary salt intake should be reduced and intake of fresh fruits and vegetables increased portions per day fish consumption especially oily ﬁ sh should be encouraged as evidence suggests that at least one ﬁ sh meal times per week can reduce the incidence of heart attack and stroke high ﬁ ber intake is also associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease physical activity observational studies have shown a strong inverse relationship between exercise and risk of coronary disease and death the effect appears to be graded such that the greater the degree of physical activity the lower the risk of coronary events this effect is mediated at least in part by weight loss a reduction in blood pressure and improvements in lipid proﬁ le par ticularly increased hdl regular aerobic exercise of moderate intensity should be undertaken t times per week for at least minutes greater frequency and dura tion of exercise is associated with increasing beneﬁ ts both in primary and secondary prevention alcohol consumption of small to moderate amounts of alcohol one or two drinks per day is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease whereas higher levels of alcohol intake particularly in binges are associ ated with an increased risk of disease the united states dietary guidelines recommend alcohol intake in moderation if at all one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men any beneﬁ t of moderate alcohol consumption must be weighed against the potential risks chapter preventive cardiology hypertension deﬁ nition and etiology there are approximately million adults in the united states with high blood pressure a continuous relationship exists between increasing blood pressure and cardiovascular risk therefore it is impossible to deﬁ ne hypertension precisely systolic blood pressure bp is at least as powerful

epidemiological studies have conﬁ rmed that a direct continu ous relationship exists between plasma cholesterol level and risk of coro nary artery disease even within the normal range of cholesterol elevated ldl cholesterol levels appear to be the primary determinant of this rela tionship but other atherogenic lipoprotein particles including very low density lipoprotein vldl chylomicron remnants and lpa also appear to play an important role as well ldl particularly modiﬁ ed ldl is recognized by the scavenger receptor on the surface of macrophages in the arterial wall which take up these cholesterolrich particles and eventually become the foam cells that form the lipidrich core of atherosclerotic plaques increasing levels of hdl involved in reverse cholesterol transport from the peripheries to the liver protect against the development of athero sclerosis an increased triglyceride level is also now recognized as an inde pendent risk factor for coronary disease emerging data suggest that the nature of the lipoprotein particles plays an important part in their atherogenicity for example small dense ldl particles as seen in subjects with diabetes are more readily taken up by macrophages and appear to be more atherogenic than larger less dense ldl lipids and risk assessment it is essential to consider the lipid proﬁ le together in the context of the other risk factors present by estimating the year cardiovascular risk although only total and hdl cholesterol are considered in most risk models ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels should also be considered in the

agents are extremely effective at lowering cholesterol levels eg the most potent statins atorvastatin and rosuvastatin can lower ldl cholesterol levels by statin therapy typically results in a small increase in hdl and decrease in triglycerides as well a large evidence base has emerged over the past decade that strongly supports the use of statins in primary and secondary prevention of cardio

widespread use these drugs are generally recommended as second or thirdline ther apy in subjects with hypercholesterolemia inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption ezetimibe this medication binds to an intestinal transport protein and inhibits chol esterol absorption ldl cholesterol is reduced by the dose is mg daily ezetimibe is most often used in combination with a statin in those patients who do not achieve their ldl cholesterol target at higher statin doses although it is effective in lowering ldl levels and has been used as monotherapy in statinintolerant patients clinical outcome data are cur rently lacking so it should not be used as ﬁ rstline therapy as a substitute for statins niacin niacin reduces hepatic vldl synthesis and inhibits fatty acid release from adipocytes hdl levels are signiﬁ cantly increased by and reduced hepatic synthesis results in a small reduction in ldl although particularly beneﬁ cial in mixed dyslipidemias use of the short acting

and coronary disease or its equivalent determine the year risk of events framingham score and categorize the patient as low moderate moderately high or high risk each category has recommended ldl goals and guidelines for when to initiate therapy see table it is also important to remember the importance of high triglycerides and low hdl when planning therapy some recommend focusing therapy on the serum totaltohdl cholesterol ratio and nonhdl cholesterol levels especially in patients with hypertriglyceridemia the goal for non hdlc in this circumstance is a concentration that is mgdl higher than that for ldl see table an elevated hdl mgdl is considered a negative risk factor therapeutic lifestyle changes including exercise weight loss and dietary modiﬁ cations are the ﬁ rst step in treatment of all patients with dyslipi demia moderate weight reduction of body weight can signiﬁ cantly improve the lipid proﬁ le and lower risk the composition of the optimal diet is controversial

obesity insulin resistance moderate hypertension dyslipidemia low hdl and high triglycerides with average cholesterol levels and low grade inﬂ ammation several deﬁ nitions of this syndrome have been proposed but the ncep atpiii diagnostic criteria table are the most practical and widely used as well as being a robust predictor of vascular risk the prevalence of this syndrome is increasing in parallel with the increase in numbers of obese and overweight individuals it has been described in a high proportion of american children and adolescents thus the meta bolic syndrome is projected to contribute substantially to the societal bur den of atherosclerotic disease in the next few decades unless effective interventions to slow and hopefully reverse this trend are delivered at a population level much of the progress that has been made in the ﬁ ght against coronary disease is likely to be overturned mechanisms of increased risk visceral obesity causes insulin resistance which is associated with increase in blood glucose and abnormalities in the lipid proﬁ le increased levels of inﬂ ammatory cytokines such as tnfa some of which are produced by adipocytes cause endothelial

thiazolidenediones see fig has theoretical beneﬁ ts but is currently under investigation as the ability of such an approach to improve outcomes compared to weight reduction and exercise alone is not yet well supported by clinical trials as far as management of the dyslipidemia is concerned treatment with a statin is clearly indicated if the year cardiac risk is t or if ldl cholesterol is elevated as per the atpiii guidelines the nature of the risk factor proﬁ le in the metabolic syndrome fre quently results in the underestimation of year risk but at present no studies are currently available

aspirin for primary prevention should be an individual clinical judgment that weighs the beneﬁ t of reducing risk of a ﬁ rst mi the risk factor proﬁ le of the patient and the adverse effects of longterm administration speciﬁ cally gastrointestinal bleeding an impor tant consideration is that when aspirin is used for primary prevention the absolute beneﬁ t is much smaller than that for secondary prevention while the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding is the same the united states preventive services task force recommends aspirin for all apparently healthy men and women whose year risk of a ﬁ rst chd event is or greater the american heart association uses a or greater cutoff risk for which the beneﬁ ts of aspirin are likely to out weigh the risks of chronic administration current data suggest that aspirin is underutilized both for primary and secondary prevention approximately of adults over age in the united states have the metabolic syndrome and a year risk of a ﬁ

considerable phenotypic variability and the hyper trophy can be concentric apical or midcavitary resulting in an intracavi tary gradient often in association with an apical aneurysm in addition genetic studies have demonstrated that affected family members may have little or no cardiac hypertrophy despite the presence of a disease causing mutation variable penetrance the reason for this marked phenotypic variability is poorly understood but is almost certainly multifactorial hcm has also been associated with accessory atrioventricular pathways and conduction abnormalities in certain families etiology hcm is an autosomal dominant inherited cardiac condition however there is marked allelic and nonallelic heterogeneity with multiple mutations more than in at least genes now identiﬁ

right ventricular cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy arvc is a disease in which the normal right ventricular myocardium is replaced by a ﬁ brofatty inﬁ ltrate it was originally termed a dysplasia reﬂ ecting the idea that it was somehow a developmental defect but further understanding has led to the appreciation that it is a continuing process and has subsequently been reclassiﬁ ed as a cardiomyopathy it can progress to right ventricular dilatation and failure and in some cases there may also be left ventricular involvement etiology half of cases are familial with an autosomal dominant pattern of inherit ance diseasecausing genes have not been found but several loci have been mapped to chromosomes and an autosomal reces sive variant which is characterized by arvc palmoplantar keratosis and wooly hair naxos disease has been mapped to chromosome symptoms patients are usually asymptomatic and presentation is usually in the form of ventricular arrhythmias with typical lbbb pattern indicating probable origin from the right ventricle therefore otherwise healthy young indi viduals can present with cardiac arrest or scd other patients present in later life with symptoms of hf with or without ventricular arrhythmias and are misdiagnosed as having dcm diagnosis diagnosis of affected individuals can be very difﬁ cult especially during family screening as standard noninvasive investigations have poor sensi tivity only a minority may have classic ﬁ ndings of typical right ventricular arrhythmias with lbbb pattern abnormal depolarizationrepolarization abnormalities particularly on right precordial ecg leads and evidence of structural abnormalities of the right ventricle right ventricular free wall abnormalities are best characterized by mri but this too has limitations therefore patients with suspected arvc but negative investigations may need repeated studies there are no established or proven speciﬁ c risk factors for scd markers of increased risk include young age at diagnosis malignant family history syncope right ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular involve ment and presence of vt on ambulatory monitoring therefore baseline investigations in addition to a carefully taken history should include the following lead and signalaveraged ecg hour ambulatory ecg monitoring exercise testing echocardiogram mri scan chapter diseases of the myocardium and pericardium treatment there are no established best treatment options for patients with arvc and as the disease is progressive antiarrhythmic options are used for symptomatic beneﬁ t in patients with hemodynamically welltolerated ven tricular arrhythmias patients who have developed rv and lv dysfunction can be managed with standard treatments for hf in severe cases transplantation may be an option antiarrhythmics bblockers alone or in combination with class i and iii antiarrhythmics are the most effective in reducing symptomatic but welltolerated ventricu lar arrhythmias sotalol and amiodarone have been shown to be most effective patients with more sustained ventricular arrhythmias may have drug therapy guided by their response during programmed electrical stimula tion but this has no proven beneﬁ t in reducing the risk of scd radiofrequency ablation a small subset of patients with drugrefractory arrhythmias who are felt to have fairly localized disease may be amenable to electrophysiological mapping and radiofrequency ablation however it must be remembered that arvc is a progressive disease this can only be viewed as a palliative procedure implantable cardioverter deﬁ brillators in patients with lifethreatening or drugrefractory ventricular arrhythmias and widespread disease icds probably offer the best protective measure against scd metabolic cardiomyopathy ischemic cardiomyopathy this is a condition in which coronary artery disease cad causes a pic ture that is often indistinguishable from dcm with or without a preceding history of angina or myocardial infarction often the degree of dysfunction is inconsistent with the extent of cad it is important to recognize patients with hibernating myocardium as they will beneﬁ t from revascularization valvular cardiomyopathy patients with valvular heart disease will develop a cardiomyopathy depend ent on the predominant valvular lesion often signiﬁ cant improvement in cardiac function can be seen after correction of the valve disease hypertensive cardiomyopathy hypertension causes lvh in response to increased afterload which is compensatory and protective to a point however there are ultimately detrimental effects on systolic and diastolic ventricular function hypertension also leads to accelerated atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease hypertensive cardiomyopathy is the most common form of hf outside the western world alcoholic cardiomyopathy chronic alcohol excess is the most common cause of dcm in the western world proposed mechanisms include direct toxic effect concomitant nutritional deﬁ ciencies especially thiamine and rarely toxic effects of additives cobalt unlike other forms of dcm abstinence from alcohol early in

instead originally described in japan it is becoming a more widely recognized syndrome in series evaluating acute coronary syndromes it accounts for about of cases the syndrome is much more common in women than in men and in a review of series postmenopausal women accounted for of the reported cases pathogenesis takotsubo cardiomyopathy is typically triggered by acute medical illness or by an extreme emotional stressor although the exact pathophysiology is not known it is hypothesized that the underlying mechanism may include catecholamine excess resulting in microvascular spasm and resultant myo cardial stunning myocarditis or coronary artery vasospasm clinical presentation patients typically present with sudden onset of substernal chest pain fol lowing an extreme emotional stressor or critical illness occasionally patients will present with heart failure symptoms or in shock the initial ecg typically reveals st elevations box cardiac biomar kers are often elevated the

agents unfortunately the infectious agent is rarely identiﬁ ed numerous bacteria viruses spirochetes fungi parasites and rickettsia can cause myocarditis see table etiology damage can result from a number of mechanisms including direct toxic effect on the myocyte production of a toxin eg diphtheria and immunologically mediated cell damage histological ﬁ ndings depend on a number of factors including the infectious agent stage of disease and the mechanism of damage damage can be focal or diffuse and is randomly distributed throughout the myocardium symptoms the clinical consequences of the damage can range from asymptomatic subclinical infection to rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal hf long term consequences are also variable patients who were initially asymptomatic can present after a prolonged latency period with dcm or have complete recovery patients who pre sent early even with fulminant hf can also have complete recovery patients with nonfulminant presentations can gradually deteriorate and recover gradually diagnosis the diagnosis is often established by identifying the associated systemic illness isolation of the infectious agent is rarely achieved although clearly supportive of the diagnosis if positive endomyocardial biopsy can be use ful in conﬁ rming the diagnosis but is frequently negative treatment management of patients with myocarditis is largely supportive physical activity should be restricted as in animal models exercise was found to be detrimental to cardiac function standard management of hf and eradication of the infectious

may cause pericardial effusion large effusions are common with neoplastic tb uremic pericarditis and myxedema pathology in addition to ﬁ brinous inﬂ ammation there is signiﬁ cant ﬂ uid exudation the pericardial ﬂ uid may be serous serosanguineous hemorrhagic or purulent depending on the underlying cause hemorrhagic effusion is common in tuberculosis or neoplasia brownish ﬂ uid with an anchovy sauce appearance of the pus is highly suggestive of amoebic pericarditis clinical features clinical presentation varies depending on the rate of accumulation of ﬂ uid the amount of ﬂ uid that accumulates and the stage at which the patient is ﬁ rst seen symptoms chest pain may be typically pericardial as described under dry pericarditis or it may be dull and heavy from distension of the pericardium dyspnea is common and orthopnea may occur later in the course of the disease cough may be present from compression of surrounding structures any constitutional symptoms depend on the cause of the disease signs typically precordial dullness extends beyond the apex beat which may be impalpable and dullness is present to the right of the sternum dullness and bronchial breathing ewarts sign at the left base posteriorly due to compression of the left lower lobe bronchus may be found cardiac tamponade should be considered in a patient with hypotension raised jvp and quiet heart sounds

pressure waveform and pulsus paradoxus differential diagnosis this includes myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism management when an effusion does not cause hemodynamic impairment and the cause is known eg uremia myxedema then no further investigations are necessary and the treatment consists of treating the underlying cause if the cause is not known then pericardiocentesis must be

mumps inﬂ uenza and varicella pericardial pain fever and malaise are typical the physical examination reveals a pericardial friction rub andor characteristic changes of acute pericarditis on ecg course in most patients the illness resolves spontaneously in weeks in some patients the illness recurs on at least one occasion in the next few weeks or months and in of patients there are multiple recurrences in the ensuing months or years benign relapsing pericarditis diagnosis it is important to search for an underlying disease see table that may require speciﬁ c therapy in most cases of suspected viral pericarditis spe cial studies for etiologic agents are not necessary because of the low diag nostic yield of viral studies and lack of speciﬁ c therapy for viral disease management nsaids are effective in most patients with viral pericarditis there are no data from randomized controlled trials to guide treatment for relapsing patients who do not respond to nsaids corticosteroids prednisone mgkg for at least month provide symptomatic relief in most patients symptoms recur in many patients when the prednisone dose is reduced colchicine mgday for days followed by mgday may be effective when nsaids and corticosteroids fail to prevent relapses if patients do not respond adequately azathioprine mgday or cyclophosphamide may be added pericardiectomy is indicated only in frequent and highly symptomatic recurrences resistant to medical therapy however postpericardiectomy recurrences may occur possibly due to incomplete resection of the pericardium tuberculous

constrictive pericarditis clinical presentation most cases have an active inﬂ ammatory ﬁ brocaseous tissue surrounding the heart and involve visceral and parietal pericardium the clinical presentation is highly variable patients range from being asymptomatic to showing severe signs and symptoms of constriction the diagnosis is often missed on cursory clinical and echocardiographic examination it is uncommon to ﬁ nd concomitant pulmonary tb and pericardial cal ciﬁ cation is found in of cases treatment the initial management of patients with noncalciﬁ c tb constrictive peri carditis is with antitb therapy since the process is an active ﬁ brocaseous condition resolution of constriction occurs in of patients with medical management over months pericardiectomy is recommended if no improvement has occurred after weeks of antitb treatment or unsatisfactory improvement after several months of treatment by contrast calciﬁ c tb pericarditis is treated by early pericardiectomy and antitb chemotherapy tb effusiveconstrictive pericarditis features this mixed form is a common presentation of tb pericarditis there is increased pericardial pressure due to effusion in the presence of visceral constriction the echocardiogram shows porridgelike exudation with loculation of the ﬂ uid treatment treatment of this condition is by standard fourdrug therapy the role of adjuvant steroids is not known the mortality is about and about of cases will come to peri cardiectomy over years of followup tb pericardial effusion tb pericardial effusion pathology pericardial effusion is the most common mode of presentation with or without tamponade the effusion is bloodstained in over of cases and may even resemble venous blood the absence of parenchymatous lung disease and the presence of hilar lymphadenopathy in many of these patients suggest a direct spread from a tb hilar node to the pericardium clinical presentation systemic symptoms are variable typical pericardial pain is uncommon and the classic ecg features of pericarditis are not seen cxr shows an enlarged globular heart small pleural effusions on one or both sides and evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in only of cases the echocardiogram shows features of pericardial effusion typically asso ciated with soft tissue density masses thickening of the visceral pericar dium and ﬁ brinous strands diagnosis a deﬁ nite diagnosis of tb pericardial effusion is based on demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial ﬂ uid or on histological section of the pericardium pericardial ﬂ uid should be sent for microscopy to identify acidfast bacilli afb and culture of tubercle bacilli the chances of a positive culture are improved by bedside inoculation of the ﬂ uid into dou blestrength kirschner culture medium pericardial biopsy and drainage offer the advantage of a histological diagnosis and early complete drain age of the pericardium this can be performed via the subxiphisternal approach under local anesthesia a probable diagnosis is made when there is proof of tb elsewhere in a patient with unexplained pericardial effusion palpation in the supracla vicular fossa will frequently reveal enlarged lymph nodes which should be biopsied afbpositive sputum will only be found in about of cases tuberculin skin testing is of little value in endemic and nonendemic areas it is not known whether the enzymelinked immunospot elispot test that detects t cells speciﬁ c for m tuberculosis antigen will perform better in tb pericarditis than the tuberculin skin test several tests have been developed for the rapid diagnosis of tb in the pericardial ﬂ uid polymerase chain reaction pcr can identify dna of m tuberculosis rapidly from only µl of pericardial ﬂ uid sensitivity speciﬁ city an adenosine deaminase ada level ul has a sen sitivity of and a speciﬁ city of a high interferong level is also a highly sensitive and speciﬁ c marker of pericardial tb chapter diseases of the myocardium and pericardium treatment treatment is by means of standard fourdrug antitb chemotherapy for months overall mortality is about repeat pericardiocentesis is required in about of patients and dur ing a year followup period about of patients will require surgical pericardiectomy while some clinicians favor the addition of steroids to conventional therapy their role in improving survival is not clearly established particu larly in the context of hiv infection uremic pericarditis uremic pericarditis pathology uremia produces a ﬁ brinous often hemorrhagic inﬂ ammation that may lead to tamponade and constriction in some cases management symptomatic pericarditis that occurs before the initiation of dialysis will respond to repeated peritoneal or hemodialysis heparinfree hemodialy sis should be used to avoid hemopericardium many patients who develop pericardial effusion while on dialysis dial ysisassociated pericarditis will respond to intensiﬁ cation of the dialysis regime those who do not respond will require drainage by either subxy phoid pericardiotomy or pericardial window pericardiocentesis is associated with a high risk of intrapericardial hemorrhage chapter diseases of the myocardium and pericardium neoplastic pericardial disease etiology this condition is usually secondary to malignancy of the bronchus breast or kidney primary tumors of the pericardium are rare and usually result from mesothelioma following asbestos exposure diagnosis metastases may produce a large hemorrhagic effusion or severe constric tion when tumor encases the heart malignant cells may be found in of cases of aspirated pericardial ﬂ uid tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen cea afetoprotein afp and carbohydrate antigens eg ca have been used in the diagnosis of malignant effusion the differentiation of tb and neoplastic effusion is virtually absolute with low ada and high cea levels management this depends on the type and stage of malignancy condition of the patient and presence of cardiac compression pericardiocentesis is effective in relieving neoplastic cardiac tamponade in the vast majority of cases commonly neoplastic pericardial disease is a preterminal event palliation for recurrent tamponade can be obtained by subxyphoid surgi cal pericardiotomy which can be performed under local anesthesia or by percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy to create a pleuropericardial win dow to allow ﬂ uid drainage into the pleural space in patients with large malignant pericardial effusions and a limited life expectancy partial pericardiectomy pericardial window through a left thoracot omy should be reserved for patients who have a better prognosis and are likely to respond to chemotherapy or radiation intrapericardial instillation of cytostaticsclerosing

clinical presentation this is rare in adults it presents as an acute fulminating infectious illness and is fatal if not treated the most important reason for this poor outlook is failure to suspect the condition in debilitated patients with overwhelm ing systemic infection diagnosis pericardiocentesis shows purulent ﬂ uid with high white cell count low glucose positive gram stain for the organism and positive pericardial ﬂ uid and blood culture treatment complete pericardial drainage is preferable through a subxyphoid pericar diotomy and systemic antibiotic therapy should be given the mortality rate is even with appropriate management drug or toxininduced pericarditis radiation pericarditis clinical features this condition usually follows treatment for lymphoma and breast cancer incidence of pericarditis depends on how much of the heart is included in the ﬁ eld of radiation the dose the duration of treatment and age of the patient radiation is a common cause of effusiveconstrictive peri carditis and also may result in myocarditis and premature coronary atherosclerosis clinical evidence of pericarditis may occur during or shortly after treat ment but is more usually delayed for approximately year the presenta tion is one of pericarditis with some effusion in about of cases there is evidence of tamponade which requires drainage management up to of patients will require pericardiectomy because of severe constriction the operative mortality is high and the postoperative year survival is very low mostly due to underlying myocardial ﬁ bro sis and severe

defects occurring in approximately of newborns advances in therapy have led to a dramatic improvement in outcome such that over of infants even with complex chd are expected to reach adoles cence and early adulthood as a result of the success of pediatric cardiology and surgery the number of adults with chd is greater than the number of pediatric cases in addition there are patients with structural or valvular chd who may present late during adulthood as of there were roughly american adults with moderate to very complex chd and with simple forms of chd many of those with chd have had palliative or reparative rather than corrective surgery and will require further cardiac operations and procedures role of specialist chd centers initial assessment of adults with known or suspected chd surgical and nonsurgical interventions eg transcatheter closure asd continuing care of patients with moderate and complex chd advice and ongoing support for noncardiac surgery pregnancy and other

limited by poor windows magnetic resonance imaging mri is ideal for assessment of extracardiac pulmonary arterial and venous trees it provides accurate quantiﬁ cation of valvar regurgitation eg assessment of pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular function following repair of tetralogy of fallot its utility is limited by the presence of implantable pacemakers and deﬁ brillators and is generally only available at academic medical centers or centers equipped to treat chd cardiac catheterization this can aid in quantifying shunts and obtaining accurate hemodynamic data it can

procedures may be required chapter congenital heart disease speciﬁ c signs in patients with chd inspection cyanosis or clubbing oxygen saturation should always be measured by pulse oximetry central cyanosis is an indication of arterial desaturation and is noted when g dl of reduced hemoglobin is circulating thus it is dependent in part on the total hemoglobin concentration and may be missing in a patient with signiﬁ cant desaturation but who is anemic differential cyanosis implies ﬂ ow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary trunk into the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery eg

parasternal heave represents right ventricular overactivity which is most marked when there is both pressure and volume overload of the chamber such as following repair of tetralogy of fallot a palpable second sound in the upper left intercostal space is detected when pulmonary hypertension is present surgical operations for chd surgical operations for chd congenital heart disease surgery in adolescents and adults should only be undertaken in specialist centers there are three categories of patients patients who have not undergone prior operations patients who have undergone previous palliative operations patients who have undergone previous reparative procedures redo sternotomy preservation of myocardial performance attention to pulmonary bed vascular abnormalities and aortopulmonary collaterals require careful prior planning and close cooperation among the surgeon cardiac anesthesiologist cardiologist and intensive care team blalocktaussig shunt a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt using a subclavian arterial conduit classical or goretex tube modiﬁ ed is used to increase pulmonary blood ﬂ ow and improve oxygenation in cyanotic chd this is a palliative procedure that has superseded earlier operations such as the waterston shunt ascending aorta to right pulmonary artery or potts shunt descend ing aorta to left pulmonary artery a catheterbased approach is now frequently used coarctation of the aorta this is relieved by either a subclavian conduit approach or direct endto end anastomosis occasionally a bypass graft is required in adult patients from the ascending to descending aorta glenn shunt the superior vena cava is anastomosed to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery as a means of improving oxygenation in infants or young children this procedure is usually conﬁ ned to patients with single ventricles and uni ventricular circulations in its classical form the right pulmonary artery was detached from the main pulmonary artery the bidirectional glenn shunt was fashioned such that blood from the superior vena cava entered both pulmonary arteries tetralogy of fallot fig this condition requires closure of the ventricular septal defect with a patch of pericardium or goretex and relief of right ventricular outﬂ ow tract obstruction by transannular patching valvectomy or placing a hom ograft or conduit between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery rastelli operation this is usually undertaken in patients with complex chd eg transpos ition of the great arteries with large ventricular septal defect the vsd is closed

resected and placed in the aortic position with the coronaries reattached a homograft is placed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery surgical operations for chd however this procedure is currently out of favor with poor outcomes in longterm followup fontan operation this represents the deﬁ nitive palliation for patients with effectively uni ventricular circulations such as mitral or tricuspid atresia blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae is directed to the pulmonary arter ies without the beneﬁ t of a subpulmonary ventricle oxygenated blood returns to the systemic ventricle and is then pumped to the aorta mustard and senning operations these were lifesaving innovations for treatment of patients with transpo sition of the great arteries they involved intraatrial redirection of oxy genated and deoxygenated blood to the systemic and pulmonary systems respectively see fig the right ventricle served as the systemic sub aortic ventricle they have been largely abandoned because of late prob lems with arrhythmias pathway obstruction and ventricular failure arterial switch this has largely superseded the mustard and senning procedures the aorta and pulmonary

an atrial communication is created by tearing a hole in the atrial septum using a balloon catheter this can be performed at the bed side under echocardiographic control or in the catheterization laboratory with both echocardiographic and angiographic guidance pulmonary valvuloplasty this is the procedure of choice for patients of all ages with pulmonary valvar stenosis it is less successful if the valve is dysplastic noonans syn drome the pulmonary valve annulus is measured by echocardiography or angiography and a balloon diameter is used it is one of the most effective transcatheter interventions aortic valvuloplasty this intervention has limited use in adults if the aortic valve is pliable but not calciﬁ ed balloon dilatation may defer the need for deﬁ nitive surgery but usually at the expense of aortic regurgitation the balloon size should not exceed the size of the aorta at the site of the valve attachment an anterograde approach via a transseptal puncture is advised to reduce the incidence of valve damage atrial septal defect most secundum atrial septal defects are amenable to percutaneous clo sure the amplatzer septal occluding device is made of nitinol a nickel titanium alloy with inherent shape memory and comprises two discs with a selfcentering waist the defect is balloon sized under transesophageal echocardiographic tee guidance defects up to mm in size

ie sinus venosus defects or partial atrioventricular septal defects procedural complications are rare in expert hands antiplatelet agents are administered for months until the device has completely endothelialized transient headaches are common in the weeks following closure but serious complications are rare these include transient ischemic episodes or stroke atrial arrhythmias and embolization of the device concomitant electrophysiological procedures may need to be under taken in patients with signiﬁ cant atrial arrhythmias ventricular septal defects indications for closing defects in adults are limited occasionally small defects can produce volume overload of the left ventricle over time and require closure such defects may be amenable to transcatheter occlusion using the amplatzer perimembranous or muscular occluding devices chapter congenital heart disease this should only be undertaken in specialist centers complete heart block and device embolization have been described coarctation of the aorta surgical correction in the adult is a major challenge with its associated risk of paraplegia both native and recoarctation of the aorta can now be suc cessfully treated by transcatheter balloon dilatation and stenting covered stents may be required for native coarctation to reduce the incidence of dissection and rupture remember that the aorta in these patients is espe cially friable and that an aortopathy commonly coexists mri is invaluable in patient selection and for selecting stent size this intervention should only be undertaken in specialist centers where expert surgical help is readily available balloon dilatation of previous patch aor toplasty carries the highest risk of aortic rupture lifelong surveillance is necessary to detect aneurysm formation patent ductus arteriosus this may occasionally present in later life if it is small or medium sized with no pulmonary hypertension it usually can be successfully occluded with a variety of transcatheter occluding devices or coils pulmonary valve implantation percutaneous transcatheter implantation of a bovine jugular venous valve mounted within a platinumiridium stent into

occurring more often in women than men avnrt characteristically causes paroxysms of severe palpitations with a pounding in the neck due to reﬂ ux of blood into the jugular veins caused by simultaneous atrial and ventricular con traction it has a benign prognosis and may require no treatment the ecg in sr is usually normal see fig the tachycardia is terminated by iv adenosine or vagal maneuvers the underlying reentrant circuit is entirely within the av node and therefore can be controlled long term with bblockers verapamil or diltiazem alternative secondline agents are ﬂ ecainide propafenone or

rheumatic heart disease is now extremely rare in women of childbearing age women with congenital heart disease who have undergone corrective or palliative surgery in childhood and survive into

ischemic heart disease is becoming more common in pregnancy as the mean age of pregnancy increases and the smoking epidemic continues dissection of the aorta and its branches occurs more commonly in preg nancy and postpartum pregnancy may cause a speciﬁ c dilated cardiomy opathyperipartum cardiomyopathy because of signiﬁ cant physiological changes in pregnancy symptoms such as palpitations and signs such as an ejection systolic murmur are very common and innocent ﬁ ndings the care of the pregnant and parturient woman with heart disease requires a multidisciplinary approach and formulation of an agreedon and documented management plan encompassing management of both planned and emergency delivery this chapter covers the most important cardiac conditions relevant to pregnancy physiological changes in pregnancy physiological changes in pregnancy cardiac output increases early in pregnancy reaching a maximum by the mid second trimester and plateaus at above prepregnancy lev els this is achieved by an increase in both stoke volume as a result of increased blood volume and heart rate table there is peripheral vasodilation and a fall in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance fig the pregnant uterus can require up to of cardiac output oxygen consumption increases throughout pregnancy and reaches above prepregnancy levels by the time of delivery although there is no increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure pcwp serum colloid oncotic pressure is reduced the colloid oncotic pressurepulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient is reduced by making pregnant women particularly susceptible to pulmonary edema pulmonary edema will be precipitated if there is either an increase in car diac preload such as infusion of ﬂ uids or increased pulmonary capillary permeability such as in preeclampsia or both in late pregnancy in the supine position pressure of the gravid uterus on the inferior vena cava causes a reduction in venous return to the heart and a consequent fall in stroke volume and cardiac output turning from the lateral to the supine position may result in a reduction in cardiac output pregnant women should therefore be nursed in the left or right lateral position whenever possible if the mother has to be kept on her back the pelvis should be rotated so that the uterus drops forward and cardiac output and uteroplacental blood ﬂ ow are optimized reduced car diac output is associated with reduction in uterine blood ﬂ ow and thus in placental perfusion this can compromise the fetus labor is associated with further increases in cardiac output in the ﬁ rst stage and in the second stage uterine contractions lead to autotransfusion of ml of blood back into the circulation the sympathetic response to pain and anxiety further elevate heart rate and blood pressure cardiac output is increased more during contractions than between contractions following delivery there is an immediate rise in cardiac output due to the relief of inferior vena cava obstruction and contraction of the uterus that empties blood into the systemic circulation cardiac output increases by followed by a rapid decline to prelabor values within about hour of delivery peripheral vascular resistance also rises transfer of ﬂ uid from the extravascular space increases venous return and stroke volume further those women with cardiovascular compro mise

tive advice maternal mortality is the danger relates to ﬁ xed pul monary vascular resistance pvr and an inability to increase pulmonary blood ﬂ ow with refractory hypoxemia most deaths can be attributed to thromboembolism hypovolemia or preeclampsia pulmonary hypertension is deﬁ ned as a nonpregnant elevation of mean not systolic pulmonary artery pressure t mmhg at rest or mmhg on exercise in the absence of a lefttoright shunt pulmonary artery sys tolic not mean pressure is usually estimated by using doppler ultrasound to measure the regurgitant jet velocity across the tricuspid valve this should be considered a screening test there is no agreedupon relation between the mean pulmonary pres sure and the estimated systolic pulmonary pressure if the systolic pul monary pressure estimated by doppler is thought to indicate pulmonary hypertension a specialist cardiac opinion is recommended if there is pul monary hypertension in the presence of a lefttoright shunt the diagnosis of pulmonary vascular disease is particularly difﬁ cult and further investi gation including cardiac catheterization to calculate pulmonary vascular resistance is likely to be necessary pulmonary hypertension as deﬁ ned by doppler studies may also occur in mitral stenosis and with large lefttoright shunts that have not reversed although such women may not have pulmonary vascular disease and a ﬁ xed pvr or this may not have been established prior to pregnancy they have the potential to develop it and require very careful monitoring with serial echocardiograms management in the event of unplanned pregnancy a therapeutic termination should be offered elective termination carries a risk of mortality hence the importance of avoiding pregnancy if possible if such advice is declined

technologies echocar diography remains the most widely used diagnostic imaging tool in clinical practice since its development by edler and herz almost ﬁ ve decades ago and routine clinical implementation a decade later echocardiography has developed into a comprehensive and practical method to rapidly and repeatedly evaluate cardiac morphology and function there are now published guidelines regarding the appropriate use of echocardiography in clinical practice correct interpretation of an echocardiogram ﬁ rst requires an understanding of the physical principles underlying the available modalities ultrasound physics all forms of ultrasonic imaging are based on generation of highfrequency mhz acoustic pressure waves from a transducer comprised of one or more piezoelectric crystals current is passed across the crystal leading to material deformation and wave transmission the piezoelectric element also serves as a receiver and waves returning from insoniﬁ ed objects eg walls valves deform the crystals which in turn generate a current that can be sampled over time because the velocity of sound is constant object location spatial res olution can be determined through timing of the returning signal the amplitude of the returning signal is based on the angle of incidence sur faces perpendicular to the ultrasound beam are stronger reﬂ ectors and the interface of acoustic impedances greater differences as occurs in the left ventricle at the tissueblood interface lead to greater reﬂ ectivity returning ultrasound information is processed for maximum image integrity and then mapped to pixels for display and storage although images may be stored on videotape current methods of digital storage and retrieval enable optimal image integrity easy access to archived stud ies for comparison and research purposes and ofﬂ ine processing mmode this was the ﬁ rst clinically available form of echocardiography and while still available on modern machines has been virtually replaced in cur rent practice by newer twodimensional d imaging techniques m or motion mode images depict a single line of ultrasound data over time fig its advantage lies in its high

cardiac imaging spect perfusion imaging single photon emission computed tomography spect is an important and wellvalidated tool used to diagnose obstructive epicardial coronary disease and provide important prognostic data in patients with known coronary disease it is the standard test to evaluate myocardial perfusion in current practice spect involves the administration of radiolabeled perfusion tracers at rest and during exercise or pharmacological stress the radionuclides decay and emit gamma photons which are detected by a gamma camera myocardial tracer uptake is proportional to regional blood blow hence allowing one to assess for heterogeneity in perfusion as occurs in patients with physiologically signiﬁ cant coronary stenoses in order for spect imaging to accurately diagnose coronary disease the stressor either exer cise or pharmacologic must induce a ﬂ ow disparity between regions sup plied by normal and stenotic arteries the sensitivity and speciﬁ city are and respectively for the diagnosis of coronary disease in intermediaterisk patients the two most commonly used radioisotopes in nuclear cardiology are thallium and technetiumm sestamibi and tetrofosmin see table technetiumm labeled compounds are preferred because the higher energy gamma photons improve image resolution less scattering and soft tissue attenuation and there is little to no redistribution which makes acquisition more practical and allows for reimaging if necessary the major disadvantage with technetiumm is hepatic and gastro intestinal uptake the primary components of a gamma camera are the following lead collimator which allows only photons traveling at to pass sodium iodide crystal converting energy of incoming photons into light photomultiplier tubes which amplify

become a powerful tool to study cardiac anat omy ct scanning involves measuring the attenuation of a fanshaped xray beam projected around a patient using multiple detectors the d projection data set is then reformatted to display images in any plane the most commonly used devices in practice today are multidetector or multislice ct scanners mdct mdct scanners use rotating gantries with a temporal resolution high enough to allow imaging of the beating heart as long as the cardiac rhythm is regular and fairly slow ie bpm bblockers are often given to achieve this newer singlesource mdct scanners acquire or slices per gantry rotation dualsource scanners have improved temporal resolution that does not necessitate slow heart rates electron beam ct ebct has been used extensively for calcium scor ing one of the advantages of ct over conventional noninvasive testing ie spect imaging is the rapidity of image acquisition a comprehensive cardiac ct scan can be acquired in a matter of seconds common applications of cardiac ct include the following pericardial disease measurement of pericardial thickness and determine presence of calciﬁ cation coronary artery calcium cac scoring ct coronary angiography a concern with cardiac ct is incidental noncardiac ﬁ ndings these images should be reviewed by or interpreted with a trained radiologist another concern particularly with newer multislice scanners is the radiation exposure to the patient which needs to be considered when ordering these tests ecgtriggered tube current modulation and pro spective gating can reduce the radiation dose administered coronary calcium scoring because calcium highly attenuates xrays ct scanning can detect calciﬁ ed atheromas with great sensitivity the amount of calcium can be quantiﬁ ed using the agatson score which is proportional to the total burden of cor onary atherosclerosis table although the presence of coronary calcium does not necessarily imply obstructive coronary stenosis a normal calcium score can exclude signiﬁ cant coronary disease with very high accuracy likewise in symptomatic patients with chest pain the presence of coronary calcium predicts sig niﬁ cant coronary stenosis with high sensitivity albeit moderate speciﬁ city in asymptomatic patients an abnormal coronary calcium score is a risk factor for future cardiac events and may aid in primary prevention strate gies especially in patients at intermediate risk based on traditional scores ie framingham age and genderspeciﬁ c thresholds should be applied when interpret ing a calcium score chapter stress testing and cardiac imaging accaha consensus routine screening with cac scoring is not recommended in asymptomatic patients with low or high risk for coronary disease based on framingham risk score in patients at intermediate risk a cac is reasonable if the results will reclassify the patient as low or high risk and alter management coronary ct angiography this technique evaluates coronary anatomy unlike stress perfusion imag ing with assesses the functional signiﬁ cance of a coronary stenosis current scanners can provide exquisitely detailed images of coronary anatomy including bypass grafts like

brillators icds indications for icd implantation icd therapies icd trouble shooting and followup chapter invasive electrophysiology mechanism of tachycardias knowledge of how arrhythmia are initiated and perpetuated is fundamen tal to understanding the techniques described in this chapter the electrical wavefront the excitable impulse is generated at the cell membrane by the action potential see chapter as one cell depolarizes it causes a reduction in negativity of the resting potential in the adjacent cells causing the adjacent cells to reach threshold potential and depolarize the shape orientation and presence of gap junctions between myocar dial cells allow the rapid spread of depolarization which can be described as an electrical wavefront after a cell has depolarized it cannot depolarize again until it repolarizes over a ﬁ xed period of time the refractory period cells that are able to depolarize are excitable and those that cannot are refractory in sinus rhythm sr the source of these wavefronts is the sinoatrial sa node and they are conducted from the atria to ventricles via the atrioventricular node avn sa nodal impulses are initiated at inter vals largely regulated by the autonomic nervous system and circulating catecholamines this control is lost in tachyarrhythmia and heart rates are inappropriate conduction block a wavefront will propagate as long as there are excitable cells in its path anatomical barriers such as the mitral valve annulus vena cava and aorta do not contain myocardial cells therefore the progression of wavefronts is halted there this is described as ﬁ xed conduction block as block is always present dead cells are another important source of ﬁ xed conduction block eg the left ventricular scar of a myocardial infarction mi functional conduction block describes block that is only present under certain conditions an example is myocardial ischemia which may alter the electrical properties of myocytes such that they do not conduct it is also a functional block that prevents a wavefront from turning back on itself as the cells behind the leading edge are temporarily refractory and force the wavefront to continue in one direction other causes of functional block are cyanosis myocardial stretch and the rate and direc tion of the wavefront arrhythmia mechanisms three distinct mechanisms are described enhanced automaticity reentry triggered activity the ﬁ rst two mechanisms account for nearly all clinical tachycardias and their characteristics are compared in table mechanism of tachycardias table

mechanism of arrhythmias enhanced automaticity if a nidus of myocardial cells depolarizes faster rapid phase of the action potential than the sa node it will act as the source of wavefronts that conduct through the heart it may be atrial or ventricular but if it occurs in the atria it will override the sa node as it occurs from a single site it is often termed focal common sites are where myocardial cells suddenly change shape or size or are under abnormal pressures such as the junction of veins and atrium svc pvs crista terminalis coronary sinus cs av node area mitraltricuspid ring and ventricular outﬂ ow tracts reentry reentry accounts for of clinical arrhythmias it is caused by a per petually propagating wavefront that it is constantly meeting excitable myocardium for reentry to occur at least two distinct pathways must exist around an area of conduction block this is best described using the example of vt due to reentry around a lv myocardial scar see fig a myocardial scar acts as an area of block around which a nor mal sinus wavefront passes via normal myocardium a and slowly through it via diseased myocardium bhence two distinct pathways the sinus beat is followed closely by a ventricular ectopic which is conducted around a normally but is blocked in b which is still refrac tory following the last sinus beat the distal end of b however is now excitable and the wavefront passes backward up b which has had time to fully recover by the time it reaches the proximal end conduction is sufﬁ ciently slow up b that now a is excitable again and the wavefront can pass down a thus a reentrant wavefront has been formed that is constantly meeting excitable myocardium triggered activity this has features of both of the above mechanisms it is caused by spon taneous hence automatic afterdepolarizations ads occurring late in phase early ads or in phase delayed ads of the action potential these ads however are often triggered by premature beats and thus are inducible like reentry if these ads reach the threshold level then a single or burst of action potentials is set off the ads can be induced experimentally by ischemia qtprolonging drugs cell injury or low potassium this mechanism underlies torsades de pointes and arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity mechanism of arrhythmias figure reentry as a mechanism of tachycardia normal sinus beat passing

been documented or is strongly suspected it is generally the ﬁ rst part of a combined procedure with catheter ablation designed to cure the arrhythmia in ep it is usual to discuss cycle lengths in ms rather than heart rates eg min ms min ms min ms mapping electrical activity in the heart the eps is wrongly considered to be complex fundamentally it is just recording of the hearts electrical signals during sinus rhythm arrhythmia or in response to pacing at speciﬁ c sites the ecg provides a great deal of this information and so a full lead ecg is recorded throughout the procedure the intracardiac electrogram egram the ecg summarizes the entire cardiac activation by placing mm elec trodes directly on the hearts endocardial surface the electrical activity at precise locations is known the egram is therefore much narrower than the ecg and is best appreciated at mms sweep speed four times faster than a standard ecg recording either the potential difference between two closely spaced electrodes a bipolar electrogram or that between one electrode and inﬁ nity a uni polar electrogram can be recorded the unipolar electrogram is more accurate regarding direction and location of electrical activity however it is subject to much greater interference a pacing current can be passed through any of these electrodes standard catheter location is shown in figure pacing protocols pacing in the eps is done in a predeﬁ ned manner termed programmed stimulation this has three forms incremental pacing the pacing interval is started just shorter than the sinus interval and lowered in ms steps until block occurs or a predetermined lower limit often ms is reached extrastimulus pacing following a train of eight paced beats at a ﬁ xed cycle length a further paced beat the extrastimulus is introduced at a shorter coupling interval the time between the last stimulus of the drive and the ﬁ rst extrastimulus the stimuli of the drive train are conventionally termed s the ﬁ rst extrastimulus s the second extrastimulus s and so on extrastimuli can also be introduced after sensed heart beats singles in sinus or sensed extras burst pacing is pacing at a ﬁ xed cycle length for a predetermined time catheters have been passed into the right heart from sheaths in the fem oral and subclavian veins under ﬂ uoroscopic guidance these images from the right anterior oblique above and left anterior oblique below dem onstrate the standard positions at the high right atrium hra close to the sa node on the his bundle his and at the rv apex rva as well as a catheter passed through the os of the coronary sinus cs which the electrophysiology study eps wraps around the left posterior atrioventricular groove from this position egrams are recorded from the left atrium and ventricle the cs catheter is often inserted via the left or right subclavian veins the intracardiac electrocardiograms conventionally ordered are hra his cs and rv not displayed here with an ecg lead at the bottom on

recovery time csnrt and sinoatrial conduction time sact are both measures of san function unfortunately they are unreliable tests as san function is greatly inﬂ uenced by autonomic tone drugs and observer error san dysfunction is best assessed with ambula tory monitoring and exercise testing eps can be considered for patients who have symptoms consistent with bradyarrhythmia syncope and for whom noninvasive evaluations have been unrevealing eps for san function has higher speciﬁ city than sensi tivity therefore a positive test is much more informative than a negative one av conduction see table heart block the degree of heart block is assessed via the ecg which can also suggest the level ie av node or his purkinje system the true level of block is easily ascertained via eps the ah time is prolonged in nodal block and the hv interval in infranodal block the ah but not the hv time may be shortened by exercise isoproterenol or atropine and prolonged by vagal maneuvers av nodal function this is assessed in both the anterograde a to v and retrograde v to a directions using both incremental pacing and extrastimuli by incremental pacing in the hra conduction is observed in the his and rva until block occurs the longest pacing interval at which block occurs in the avn is the anterograde wenckebach cycle length wcl normal values are ms however this increases with age and auto nomic inﬂ uences the retrograde wcl is also measured although absent va conduction can be normal extrastimulus pacing is also performed from the hra as the coupling interval between s and s is reduced av conduction is observed the longest ss interval at which av block occurs is the anterograde avn effective refractory period erp this is usually measured at drive trains of and ms if va conduction is present the retrograde avn erp is measured decremental conduction this is the key physiological property of the av node as the interval between successive impulses passing through the av node decreases the conduction velocity within the av node also decreases in av conduction this is manifest as a prolongation of the ah and av interval as the atrial pacing interval decreases this phenomenon can be observed during incremental and extrastimu lus pacing during extrastimulus pacing if the ah interval is plotted against the ss aa an anterograde conduction curve can be plotted uses of the eps dual av nodal physiology it is possible in many patients but not all to identify two electrical con nections between the atrial myocardium surrounding the compact av node and the node itself which have different conduction properties the slow pathway has slower conduction velocity but a shorter erp than the fast pathway with faster conduction and a longer erp this is observed by plotting an anterograde conduction curve for longer aa intervals av conduction is preferentially via the fast pathway however once the fast pathway erp is reached conduction is via the slow pathway and consequently the ah time suddenly prolongs this is called an ah interval jump and is deﬁ ned as a lengthening of the ah by ms following reduction in the aa interval by ms see fig dual avnodal

nondecremental av conduction times and broadening of the qrs complex will be observed as the pacing interval shortens if the erp of the ap is longer than the erp of the av node then the qrs will

of xray catheter ablation catheter ablation in medical terms ablation is the removal of tissue as many tachycardias depend on discreet foci or pathways to be sustained they are amenable to cure by destruction of these areas energy sources for ablation radiofrequency rf energy cells are destroyed by heating c the rf generator delivers an alter nating current of khz between the active catheter electrode and a large indifferent electrode placed on the patients skin the ions within cells immediately adjacent to the catheter are agitated and generate heat resistive heating the heating power generated in this way dramatically decreases as the distance form the catheter increases the remaining heat is conducted away to the surrounding tissue a lesion of mm depth is formed after seconds which is sufﬁ cient to destroy the full thickness of atrial myocardium catheters are fr with tip electrodes of mm as standard or to mm where larger lesions are desired if the temperature approaches c boiling of cell water occurs gen erating steam that escapes either by exploding through the endocardium causing a large lesion cavitation steampop or the pericardium per foration tamponade temperature is monitored at the tip of the catheter and power delivery automatically limited to prevent such overheating the generator allows the power temperature and duration of each rf delivery to be adjusted cooled rf the tip of the catheter is cooled during rf by the ﬂ ow of blood so the hottest part of an rf lesion is mm beneath the surface stasis of ﬂ ow occurs as the lesion is formed hence the temperature rises limiting the amount of power delivered and thus the size of the lesion normal saline passed through a lumen closed or open in the tip of the catheter at a rate of mlhr continuously

has iv access prior to entering the lab chapter invasive electrophysiology atrial tachyarrhythmias mechanism all regular atrial tachyarrhythmias should be named mechanistically ie either focal atrial tachycardia or macroreentrant atrial tachycardia which includes atrial ﬂ utter focal atrial tachycardia the mechanism may be due to enhanced automaticity or microreentry common foci are the crista terminalis pvla junction vena cavara junction and triangle of koch macroreentrant atrial tachycardia the most common form is typical atrial ﬂ utter this is an ecg diagnosis ie p wave rate min there is a reentry circuit contained within the ra rotating counterclockwise around the tricuspid valve and dependent on conduction through the tricuspid isthmus see fig the opposite of this is reverse typical ﬂ utter reentry circuits are also found in the left atrium following cardiac sur gery or ablation of atrial ﬁ brillation or in congenital heart disease these have varying circuits that need to be carefully mapped before ablation can be performed atrial ﬁ brillation the chaotic electrical wavefronts are seen because the atria do not acti vate uniformly two potential mechanisms account for this focal a single source of wavefronts emerges from cells with either enhanced automaticity such as an atrial tachycardia located in a pv or a single small reentry circuit microreentry these depolarize so rapidly that the rest of the atria cannot conduct them uniformly and the wavefronts break up to give multiple wavefronts ﬁ brillatory conduction this is usually the mechanism of paroxysmal af and these foci are considered triggers of af multiple reentry this underlies permanent af four to six separate reentry circuits or rotors of constantly varying course and velocity rotate around the atria colliding with each other and anatomical structures such as veins and valves they are selfperpetuating the larger the atrium the more room these wave fronts have to rotate and the more likely they will be sustained as any episode of af persists atrial dilation due to mechanical stunning increases remodeling which explains the natural progression of af from paroxysmal to persistent to permanent af begets af atrial tachyarrhythmias mechanism figure mechanism of typical atrial ﬂ utter a diagram of the right atrium with anterior surface cut open and swung out to the left the arrow represents

easily mapped with an ablation catheter via the ivc but the la requires a transeptal puncture a successful site usually has a local electrogram at least ms ahead of the onset of the p wave success rates are typical atrial ﬂ utter the reentry circuit can be interrupted by creating a series of ablation lesions creating a line of conduction block between the ivc and tricuspid valve that disrupts conduction through the ra isthmus see figs and this is therefore a purely anatomical procedure that can be per formed in sr or during tachycardia the tv annulus is usually mapped with a pole catheter alternately nonﬂ uoroscopic catheter location systems can be used to map the ra and isthmus and guide the catheter during ablation success is proven by demonstrating that there is conduction block in both directions across the ra isthmus bidirectional block acute success occurs in of cases with a relapse thirty percent of patients who undergo atrial ﬂ utter ablation later develop af ablation of atrial tachycardias figure ablation of typical atrial ﬂ utter an ablation catheter is passed up from the ivc and a series of burns is made in the ra isthmus to join the tv to the ivc with a line of scar in this way no activation can pass through and the reentry circuit of typical atrial ﬂ utter is broken see fig for landmarks on the diagram tv ivc chapter invasive electrophysiology catheter ablation of atrial ﬁ brillation there are two main catheter strategies to prevent recurrences of afabolishing the focal triggers and changing the atrial substrate such that multiple reentry circuits cannot be sustained single focal trigger an example is focal at from the pv this is selectively ablated in the same way as described above this is rarely a cure of af as there are often multiple triggers in addition ablation within the pvs increases the risk of developing pulmonary vein stenosis and is not generally a ﬁ rstline approach abolish potential triggers from affecting the atrial myocardium all four pvs are isolated this is done in two ways create a line of conduction block outside the ostia of the veins anatomical isolation see fig b isolating not just the vein but also the la tissue adjacent to the veins the risk of pv stenosis is virtually eliminated pvi is currently the preferred method for rfa of af selectively ablate all the electrical connections between the la and each pv electrical isolation see fig a an important risk if ablating in the pv is pv stenosis which causes progressive dyspnea and is very difﬁ cult to manage in some centers it is common to also ablate electrical signals in the supe rior vena cava and coronary sinus for paroxysmal af clinical success rates using this technique are in published series newer approaches also include mapping the la for complex fraction ated electrograms cfes and then ablating the cfes that may serve as triggers or drivers of atrial ﬁ brillation linear ablation the la and ra can be compartmentalized by creating long lines of ablation within them these interrupt the multiple reentry circuits and hence af cannot be sustained this treatment was pioneered by the car diac surgeons performing the surgical maze with great success however improvements in catheter technology and nonﬂ uoroscopic localization systems eg carto or ensite navx have made it feasible to do this percutaneously this treatment is suitable for symptomatic patients with persistent or permanent af in addition to isolating the pvs lines are drawn across the roof of the la between the lipv and mv the ra isthmus and between the svc

risking pulmonary vein stenosis lasso catheter ablation catheter a b chapter invasive electrophysiology mechanism of av reentry tachycardias in young patients with paroxysmal regular narrow complex tachycardia the diagnosis is either avnrt or avrt the mechanism of both is reen try see fig the substrate for avnrt is dual avn pathways and for avrt the presence of an ap occasionally an atrial tachycardia may give an identical ecg appearance diagnostic testing four standard catheters are positioned see fig and an eps is carried out see table look for evidence of dual avn physiology and pres ence of an ap if tachycardia is induced atrial activation is observed to see whether it is via the avn avnrt or an ap avrt look closely for avn block and bb block especially at the onset and termination of tachycardia hsvpbs his synchronous premature beats are introduced to identify whether an ap is mediating the tachycardia avrt av block if avn block occurs but tachycardia persists it is almost always an atrial tachycardia onset avn jump immediately followed by tachycardia indicates avnrt loss of preexcitation followed by tachycardia indicates avrt termination last tachycardia complex atrial block in avn avnrt or avrt almost certainly not atrial tachycardia last tachycardia complex ventricular atrial tachycardia avnrt or avrt still possible his synchronous ventricular premature beats hsvpbs the aim is to introduce a ventricular paced beat exactly coincidental with the his potential during tachycardia to see whether the ventricle is an essential component of the reentry circuit fig to do this the cycle length of the tachycardia is measured and a single sensed extrastimulus is delivered from the catheter in the rv at ms less than the cycle length this is repeated reducing the coupling interval by ms each time until it is clear that the sensed extra is prehis tachycardia is then terminated and the electrograms are analyzed analysis fig the hh and aa intervals are measured to ensure a stable tachycardia the paced vpb must be synchronous with the his potential the aa intervals before and after the hsvpb are measured if the subsequent a is premature this implies that the atrium must have been activated via an ap as we know the his bundle is refractory due the presence of the anterograde potential and that the ventricle is part of the reentry circuit hence avrt if the a is not advanced it suggests that this is avnrt but does not preclude avrt mechanism of av reentry tachycardias figure his synchronous ventricular premature beats hsvpbs resetting tachycardia from top to bottom intracardiac electrograms from high right atrium his bundle catheter proximal to distal cs catheter proximal to distal and four surface ecg leads the tachycardia cycle

electrophysiology av reentry tachycardias ablation avrt ablation must be performed during ventricular pacing or avrt to iden tify the location of the ap unless it is manifest on the resting ecg ie wpw the earliest atrial activation is identiﬁ ed with an almost continu ous vthena electrogram its general location is found by bracketing it with a diagnostic catheter on the valve annulus ie the cs catheter on the left side or a multipolar catheter on the right side see fig the precise location is then found with the ablation catheter a true annular site is needed for success so an equalsized atrial and ventricular component on the mapping catheter is looked for leftsided aps are approached either retrogradely via the aortic valve and lv or anterogradely transseptal puncture following ablation full ep testing is repeated va conduction should be absent or via the avn concentric if va conduction persists adenosine boluses are given to demonstrate both va and av block avnrt the target is the slow avn pathway see fig b this is found inferior to the his bundle close to the mouth of the cs in the inferior aspect of the triangle of koch anatomically guided slow pathway ablation is con ducted in the area along the inferior part of kochs triangle extending from the tv annulus to the anterior edge of the cs os with continuous ecg monitoring rf energy is delivered and usually transient slow junctional escape beats are seen as the cells die if the cath eter moves or any av or va block occurs ablation is stopped immedi ately if the lesion is therapeutic a full ep study is then repeated to test and ensure that there is no avnrt a successful procedural outcome is the inability to induce tachycardia and complete loss of dual avnodal physiology conventionally the pres ence of a jump and a single echo beat is permitted providing tachycardia cannot be induced if isoproterenol was needed to induce tachycardia before the ablation it should also be used during postablation testing following ablation full ep testing is repeated va conduction should be absent or via the avn concentric if va conduction persists adenosine boluses are given to demonstrate both va and av block av reentry tachycardias ablation figure a orthodromic avrt via a leftsided accessory pathway ap activation from a to v is down the atrioventricular node avn then across the ventricular

leftsided ap as shown here would be accessed by a transseptal puncture or retrogradely via aortic valve and lv b typical avnrt activates from the atrium to the avn via the slow pathway sp and from the

a small percentage of patients with vt and structural heart disease are suitable for ablation the vt needs to be relatively well tolerated see fig and ideally is monomorphic in this group success

icd needs to be reduced incessant vt vt in normal hearts ablation offers a cure for these patients cure rvot and fascicular tachycardia are mapped during vt looking for the earliest ventricular activation mechanism of vt in structural heart disease vt almost always has a reentry mechanism scarred ventricular myocardium due to ischemia cardiomyopathy etc provides the substrate for reentry as described previously a stable reentry circuit can break down into chaotic activation of ﬁ brillation vf hence the link between vt and sudden death mapping reentry vt to successfully map the reentry circuit the patient must be in vt activa tion mapping thus the vt needs to be hemodynamically well tolerated remote deﬁ brillation paddles are attached to the patient so that if vf or hypotensive vt occurs it can be immediately cardioverted the aim is to identify the critical pathway at which the circuit is most susceptible to destruction this is achieved by entrainment mapping alternately d noncontact scar mapping can be performed in sr and escape pathways can be eliminated by ablation entrainment of vt this can only be performed on tachycardias with a reentry mechanism the ablation catheter is moved around the ventricle to sites where the cir cuit is expected ie adjacent to areas of scar by pacing with this catheter at a rate just faster than the tachycardia cycle length a vt is entrained if it is following the same circuit but at a faster rate if the ecg during pacing is a surface lead match to the clinical vt then this is concealed entrainment this implies that the pacing catheter is within the critical portion of the circuit to conﬁ rm this when pacing is stopped the return cycle length or postpacing interval the time from the ﬁ nal paced beat to the next activation at the catheter should be almost identical to the tachycardia cycle length ablation technique the standard steps of a vt ablation are as follows induce vt ensure similar to clinical vt and well tolerated map vt to identify critical diastolic pathway very early local electrogram occurring middiastole ms ahead of ecg ablation of ventricular tachycardia concealed entrainment during pacing return cycle length postpacing interval tachycardia cycle length ms deliver energy at site meeting criteria above if vt is terminated attempt to reinduce again failed ablation if conventional ablation fails alternative approaches are as follows arrhythmia cardiac surgery ablate the epicardial surface of the heart by delivering the catheter via the pericardium as for a pericardial aspiration alcohol ablation via a small terminal coronary branch subtending the scarred area supporting reentry this gives the patient a controlled small mi that destroys the critical portion of the reentry circuit

provide evidence to support their use in both primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death initial implants used epicardial leads and required surgical implantation the generators were large and placed in abdominal pockets currently the devices are implanted transvenously and the generators placed in the pectoral region icds employ a series of complex sensing algorithms for arrhythmia detection and use tiered therapy of pacing and shocking to treat arrhyth mia as well as to minimize myocardial injury components a typical pulse generator consists of a lithium silver vanadium oxide bat tery an aluminum electrolytic capacitor and sensing circuitry that can sense local electrograms and ﬁ lter out noise like skeletal myopotentials deﬁ brillators have at least one lead in the rv for pacingsensing and deﬁ brillation there may be a second lead in the svc or a dual coil lead to lower deﬁ brillation threshold an atrial lead can be implanted for dualchamber pacemaker indications or to help with detection or discrimination of arrhythmias detection most leads sense between the tip of the lead and an electrode anywhere along the length of the shocking coil integrated bipolar sensing potential problems are with noise farﬁ eld sensing or postshock undersensing true bipolar sensing between a ring and tip electrode is more reliable but requires the lead to have three conductors basic detection of vt involves a heart rate above which therapy will be delivered modern devices can be programmed to have multiple detec tion zones each with its own speciﬁ c therapies rate detection is very reliable but susceptible to inappropriate therapies for sinus tachycardia or poorly controlled atrial ﬁ brillation this is where medical therapy such as bblockers is

artery vascular access the femoral artery procedure for femoral artery access the standard approach for left heart catheterization is the right common femoral artery the artery is located by palpating below the inguinal ligament the ideal position for puncture being approximately cm below the inguinal ligament and slightly lateral to the position of the vessel see fig shave area and disinfect the area should be anesthetized generously with of local anesthetic usually ml of or up to ml of lidocaine warn the patient of pins and needles or transient numbness in the leg that may be caused by the effects of lidocaine on the femoral nerve the procedure used to puncture the artery is known as the seldinger technique a hollow needle is introduced slowly it is often possible to feel the pulsations of the artery via the needle before the vessel is punctured when the needle is introduced into the vessel pulsatile ﬂ ow conﬁ rms its position in the arterial lumen at this point a wire can be advanced into the vessel and toward the heart this should be performed under ﬂ uoroscopic guidance the needle is then withdrawn and a hemostatic sheath usually fr fr diameter is introduced over the wire the hemostatic sheath allows the introduction of a guide wire and catheter into the femoral artery while preventing excess bleeding from the femoral puncture site sheath removal this can be performed immediately after diagnostic angiography or after an interval of hours if heparin has been administered hemostasis can be achieved by manual compression or by using a compression device eg

punctured at the artery should be punctured as proximally as possible and care should be taken to avoid the ﬂ exor retinaculum fig once pulsatile ﬂ ow is obtained a guide wire can then be advanced through the needle and into the vessel it is usual to make a small incision in the skin to allow passage of an arterial sheath care should be taken not to damage the radial artery while making this incision thus the blade should be used to incise in the longitudinal plane rather than transversely to reduce the risk of completely transecting the artery a variety of long and short sheaths are commercially available the advan tage of long sheaths is that they minimize trauma to the radial artery complications radial artery spasm this is the most common complication of radial artery puncture and sheath introduction there are various techniques aimed at preventing radial artery spasm from occurring careful patient selection avoiding small and difﬁ cult to palpate radial arteries adequate patient sedation if required pain provokes spasm the use of a cocktail of drugs introduced directly into the radial artery a variety of different regimens have been described we use mg nitroglycerin mg verapamil and u unfractionated heparin ufh made up to ml with normal saline repeated doses of nitrates or verapamil up to mg given directly into the sheath or in the catheter may be required

coronary angiographic catheters the catheters used in diagnostic coronary angiography come in a wide variety of preformed shapes in the united states the most commonly used preshaped catheters are the

is measured in french gauge fr catheters between fr and fr are commonly used fig catheter advancement and manifold usage a j tipped guide wire is placed within the ﬂ ushed catheter which is then passed into the hemostatic sheath the guide wire is advanced ahead of the catheter under ﬂ uoroscopic guidance until it reaches the aortic root just above the aortic valve the catheter is then advanced to this position and the guiding wire is removed see box to ensure that no air or clot is within the catheter a small volume of blood ml is aspirated from the catheter directly into a syringe

reduce the torque to prevent the catheter from overshooting there is often a noticeable lateral movement as the catheter enters the artery before contrast is injected it must be ensured that the pressure tracing transduced from the tip of the catheter is not damped which can suggest that the catheter has selectively intubated the conus branch of the right coronary artery and injection of

th ed copyright elsevier x y lv mmhg lv intravascular ultrasound intravascular ultrasound intravascular ultrasound ivus is a technology that allows direct visualiza tion of atherosclerotic plaque and the vessel lumen fig ultrasound images are produced by passing an electrical current through a piezoelec tric crystal that expands and contracts to produce sound waves when electrically stimulated these sound waves are reﬂ ected from tissues and return to the transducer where they are detected and converted to an electrical impulse that can be presented graphically a phased array of crystals usually is used and these are sequentially activated to produce circumferential imaging the equipment required to perform an ivus examination involves a miniaturized ultrasound transducer mounted on a catheter usually fr gauge and computer interface that carries out image reconstruction examination technique intracoronary nitroglycerin and iv heparin should be administered the ivus catheter should be carefully advanced distal to the area of interest a motorized pullback device is then used to withdraw the ivus catheter proximally at a ﬁ xed speed landmarks such as side branches can be useful and positions may also be recorded angiographically advantages of ultrasound full circumference of vessel wall is seen not just two surfaces as in angiography and is thus the method of choice to determine vessel luminal area ivus is useful in imaging ambiguous lesions intermediate lesions of unknown severity ostial stenosis left main stem disease bifurcation lesions it images the plaque not

coronary stenting angioplasty and coronary stenting currently coronary stents are implanted in of revascularization pro cedures in the united states ahaacc guidelines state that stents should be used routinely for people with either stable or unstable angina or with acute myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous intervention angioplasty before stents became widely used in the mid to late s balloon angioplasty alone was the most common percutaneous treatment for signiﬁ cant coronary artery lesions see box the two main designs of balloon catheters now commonly used are overthewire and rapid exchange systems both types of catheter consist of three parts the shaft there are two main varieties the hypotube the advantage of which is a better balance between strength and ﬂ exibility the core wire design which is superior in terms of ﬂ exibility the lumen coaxial design a tube within a tube is the most common the balloon these are constructed from varying plastics eg polyethylene nylon the mix of which affects the balloons compliance the design of the tip is important as tapered tips are less traumatic when crossing index lesions the balloon may also have a hydrophilic coating plain old balloon angioplasty poba remains indicated in the treatment of some coronary artery lesions particularly small vessels vein grafts and bifurcation side branches in which the beneﬁ t of stenting has not been clearly demonstrated it is also used for patients who need revasculariza tion prior to noncardiac surgery thus minimizing the bleeding risk of dual antiplatelet agents required after stent placement coronary stenting stents can be made of stainless steel cobaltbased alloy titanium nitinol or polymer most stents used today are stainless steel and balloon mounted the primary function of a stent is to act as a scaffold to maintain ves sel patency see fig thus much of the success of stents is due primarily to their mechanical ability to produce large acute gains in lumen dimensions currently there are two types of stents available for clinical practice the bare metal stent bms and the drugeluding stent des with the bms there is an increased risk of instent restenosis isr as a result of intimal hyperplasia after stent deployment by contrast use of the des decreases signiﬁ cantly the incidence of isr because of the antiproliferative action of the agents that recover the stent the delayed healing of the vessel wall has led to the occurrence of acute and late episodes of stent thrombosis which requires the continuous long term use of double antiplatelet agents years in the case of bms weeks of double antiplatelet therapy followed by continuous asa use is the recommended approach chapter cardiac catheterization box angioplasty procedure cannulate artery with the chosen guiding catheter ideally the guiding catheter should be coaxial with the coronary ostium thus allowing maximum support and minimizing trauma to the vessel a steerable guide wire is introduced to the catheter via the hemostatic valve the tip of the guide wire may be preshaped however many operators prefer to take a straight guide wire and shape the tip by hand using ﬂ uoroscopy and contrast to delineate the coronary anatomy the guide wire is advanced along the vessel beyond the narrowing and placed as distally as possible in the vessel an appropriately sized balloon is then chosen the guiding catheter can be used as a reference when sizing the vessel for calciﬁ c lesions and instent restenosis shorter balloons with higher rated burst pressure may be better the balloon is advanced along the guide wire to the correct position in some situations it may be difﬁ cult to pass the balloon to the desired position thus deeper insertion of the guide catheter or a more supportive guide catheter may be needed radioopaque markers are used to position the balloon accurately inﬂ ation should be undertaken under xray screening to ensure that the balloon does not move fig

removed leaving the stent in place d a b c d restenosis following ptca restenosis following ptca pathophysiology the restenotic process consists of a series of complex events vessel injury leads to platelet activation and local thrombosis an inﬂ ammatory reaction is invoked with neutrophil monocyte and lymphocyte migration to the site of injury smooth muscle proliferation is driven by activated platelets and inﬂ ammatory mediators finally negative inward remodeling can occur resulting in lumen compromise and restenosis these processes occur at different rates and may occur to different degrees depending on the nature of vessel injury and individual patient characteristics the problem large randomized trials have established that following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca restenosis rates in the treated vessel are between and following poba and follow ing stent implantation they are higher still in selected highrisk patients eg diabetics this relatively high incidence of angiographic restenosis however translates into revascularization in about of patients in whom clinical restenosis is said to have occurred prevention of restenosis mechanical stent implantation stent implantation reduces restenosis rates by increasing the mean lumi nal diameter after angioplasty and preventing elastic recoil and adventitial constriction

thrombosis chapter cardiac catheterization drugeluting stents implantation of stents has to a great extent overcome the problem of elastic recoil and negative remodeling following ptca it is thus evident that neointimal proliferation resulting in stent restenosis remains the major limiting factor for stenting procedures much research has focused on the role of antiproliferative agents in the reduction of restenosis and recently drugeluting stents have emerged as the preeminent solution to this problem drugeluting stents are coated stents capable of releasing bioactive components into the local tissue and bloodstream see box the advent of stents as a platform for the delivery of drugs with subsequent reduction in rates of stent restenosis is radically changing the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease the number of cabg procedures performed worldwide is falling with more patients who previously would only have been candidates for cabg being treated by percutaneous coronary intervention pci increasingly the favorable results obtained with des mean that pci is performed in complex cases such as lmca stenosis diffuse disease and bifurcation anatomy several large rcts which have demonstrated both the safety and efﬁ cacy of these stents have supported the introduction of des into routine clinical practice sirolimuseluting stents the drug sirolimus has potent antifungal immunosuppressive and antimi totic properties this agent was approved for rejection prophylaxis in renal transplantation in with trials of a sirolimuscoated coronary stent following soon thereafter the ﬁ rst human experience of a sirolimuscoated stent patients illustrated a virtual absence of neoinitimal proliferation at followup box drugeluting stents similarities between tumor growth and benign neointimal proliferation introduced the concept that immunosuppressant and cytotoxic agents might be beneﬁ cial for preventing instent restenosis incorporation of these agents into stent coatings using a number of techniques has now enabled delivery of the active agent directly to its site of action while limiting systemic side effects crucially the coatings allow sustained release of the agent such that the therapy is present at the time that the target mechanism is physiologically active the commonly used agents are sirolimus which has a cytostatic action and paclitaxel which is cytotoxic other agents include everolimus and zatorolimus drugeluting stents the seminal ravel study enrolled patients randomly allocated to bx velocity stent or sirolimuseluting bx velocity stent the cypher stent it reported restenosis in the group treated with the des the largescale sirius study n conﬁ rmed the potent antirestenosis effects of cypher stents paclitaxel eluting stents paclitaxel has potent antitumor activity via its action as a microtubule stabilizing agent coronary stents eluting paclitaxel have been extensively investigated taxus i studied patients

practice this translates to coronary artery lesions in approximately of patients under going pci chapter cardiac catheterization stent thrombosis it should be appreciated that documentation of st by angiography under estimates the real incidence of this event since some of the patients with stent thrombosis develop mi or die without angiographic documentation of stent thrombosis to address this issue an academic research consortium arc com posed of clinical investigators industry representatives and regulatory authorities including the fda has proposed new deﬁ nitions for st in an attempt to establish uniformity and improve sensitivity for the diagnosis of st there are three levels of evidence in deﬁ ning st deﬁ nite stent thrombosis angiographic conﬁ rmation is based on timi thrombolysis

months after implantation of sirolimuseluting stents and for months after implantation of paclitaxeleluting stents with lifelong aspirin however concerns about longterm safety were ﬁ rst made public in after several case reports were published that suggested that even late after des placement discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may allow stent thrombosis this appears to be due to failure of des to reendothelialize these concerns were conﬁ rmed when nonselected patients with stented lesions surviving months without major events were fol lowed for year after the discontinuation of clopidogrel in the basket late trial which showed that documented late stent thrombosis and related deathtarget vessel mi were twice as frequent after des vs bms vs thrombosisrelated events occurred between and days after the discontinuation of clopidogrel presenting as mi or death in of the cases since then multiple trials registries and metaanalyses have studied the incidence of des st with numbers that range from to based on these data the fda now recommends continuous use of dual antiplatelet therapy for years if there are not major bleeding complications chapter cardiac catheterization physiological assessment of coronary ﬂ ow the shortcomings of coronary angiography in the physiological assessment of coronary stenosis are clear intravascular ultrasound can provide infor mation on the size of the lumen and the composition of plaque but again gives no information on the effect that an atheromatous plaque may have on coronary ﬂ ow the knowledge as to whether a narrowing seen on angiography is the culprit causing hemodynamic effects and thus anginal symptoms is valuable when guiding percutaneous intervention the fractional ﬂ ow reserve ffr correlates distal coronary pressure to myocardial blood ﬂ ow during maximum hyperemia induced by infusion of adenosine or papaverine ffr is deﬁ ned as maximum myocardial blood ﬂ ow in the presence of a stenosis divided by the theoretical maximum ﬂ ow in the absence of a stenosis see fig thus the information derived from ffr allows an onthespot diag nosis of the extent to which a given stenosis contributes to myocardial ischemia and angina and can guide decisions regarding revascularization at present the best established indication for coronary ffr estimation is as a diagnostic tool to assess severe coronary stenosis and for this it is extremely sensitive when used with a cutoff point of the technique has also been used to optimize the results of stent implantation two technologies are currently available that provide hemodynamic information derived from ffr calculations these are pressure wires which consist of a pressure transducer mounted on a guide wire and doppler ﬂ ow wires which examine coronary ﬂ ow velocities using spectral analysis pressure wire eg the pressurewire radi medical systems volcano medical systems the pressure transducer is located at the transition between the radiopaque wire tip and the nonradiopaque stem the analyzer shows simultaneous aortic and intracoronary pressure as well as instantaneous ffr doppler wire eg flowwire endosonics this obtains information on coronary ﬂ ow velocity in the central area of the arterial lumen combining ﬂ ow and ecg information it calculates systolic and diastolic components of ﬂ ow velocity at baseline following induction of hyperemia the machine can calculate the coronary ﬂ ow velocity reserve physiological assessment of coronary flow figure during maximal arteriolar vasodilatation the resistance of the myocardium is minimal and so maximum myocardial blood ﬂ ow is proportional to hyperemic perfusion pressure this equals pdpv as there is no decline in pressure along a normal coronary artery and neglecting pv this implies that in a normal epicardial artery perfusion pressure at hyperemia equals pa in the presence of a stenosis hyperemic perfusion pressure decreases to pd after the stenosis thus the maximum ﬂ ow in the presence of a stenosis as a ratio fraction of normal maximum ﬂ ow is represented by the ratio of perfusion pressures pdpa this fraction of normal maximum ﬂ ow which is maintained despite the stenosis is called the fractional ﬂ ow reserve ffr reproduced with permission from pijls nh heart pa pa pd pd pv q p ffrmyo pa pd pv chapter cardiac catheterization primary

atherosclerotic plaques can be responsible for sudden death due to myocardial infarction these high risk or vulnerable plaques are left untreated as it is unclear which will progress to rupture

artery with the occlusion being known to have been present for months the age and length of the occlusion are the main determinants of success of pci eg see box the objectives in treating ctos per cutaneously are as follows crossing of the total occlusion with a guide wire and advancement of this wire into the distal vessel inability to cross with the guide wire is the reason for failure in of attempts at cto pci dilatation of the underlying occlusion preservation of the newly recanalized lumen by the implantation of a stent and by pharmacological means techniques that may improve success aggressive guide catheter support including deep cannulation of the coronary artery overthewire balloon to support the guide wire as it is advanced against the cto stiffer guide wires that require greater forces to deﬂ ect the tip and may be more successful in penetrating the cap of the cto great care must be taken with guide wires of this nature as there is risk of perforation of the target vessel unfortunately if the lumen is recanalized the rates of reocclusion are high even when the cto is stented bifurcation lesions a simple deﬁ nition of bifurcation lesions can be the involvement of a side branch with a reference diameter mm in the stenosis ivus studies show that plaque in the main vessel almost invariably extends some dis tance into side branches that arise within the plaque furthermore angi oplasty to a plaque will often cause plaque shift the socalled snow plow effect into the daughter vessel unless ﬂ ow in the side branch was severely impaired or the ostium severely narrowed during the treatment of the main vessel a singlestent technique is preferable to the use of two stents this is the socalled pro visional stenting technique see fig dilating with a balloon through the stent struts carries the risk of deforming the distal parts of the stent and failure of adequate apposition of stent to vessel wall this carries a high risk of thrombosis and restenosis

nothing to the beneﬁ cial effects provided by aspirin aspirin usually mg once daily initiated at least hours prior to procedure is recommended in patients undergoing elective pci thienopyridines clopidogrel and ticlopidine are thienopyridine derivatives that inhibit platelet function independent of aspirin by interference with the platelet adp receptor early studies showed that a dual

microcir culation eg plaque debris thrombus and ﬁ brin during balloon inﬂ ation and stent deployment is becoming increasingly recognized as a cause of suboptimal results after pci distal embolization leads to poor ﬂ ow in the proximal vessel undergoing intervention due to occlusion of distal micro vasculature the noreﬂ ow phenomenon vein grafts and thrombotic lesions are now recognized as being par ticularly prone to complications arising from distal embolization which is seen in up to of vein grafts these often contain thrombus at the time of pci hence the use of distal protection devices should be considered in these angioplasty subsets devices for distal protection devices can be broadly split into those that occlude the conduit distally and then allow aspiration of debris or distal ﬁ lters that capture debris downstream balloon occlusion devices percusurge guardwire this consists of three parts the guardwire temporary occlusion catheter which is placed distally in the vessel to allow occlusion the microseal adapter which allows control over the inﬂ ation and deﬂ ation of the balloon the export aspiration catheter which allows collected debris to be aspirated into a ml syringe one of the main disadvantages of this system is that the target vessel is temporarily occluded thus the distal myocardium may be rendered ischemic filter devices angioguard this device consists of an angioplasty guide wire with an expandable ﬁ lter at the distal tip the ﬁ lter can be expanded once the target lesion has been crossed anterograde blood ﬂ ow in the vessel is maintained and displaced debris should theoretically be collected in the ﬁ lter the ﬁ lter is then collapsed and withdrawn into the retrieving catheter filterwire ez fig this device consists of a ﬁ sh mouth opening distal ﬁ lter mounted on an angioplasty guide wire the mouth of the ﬁ lter in theory expands to ﬁ ll the entire lumen of the vessel the ﬁ lter is deployed by withdrawing a delivery sheath and

times greater than in premenopausal women of the same age this is thought to be secondary to the cardioprotective effects of estrogen in the basic science arena researchers have demonstrated that estrogen has sys temic effects as well as direct effects on the vasculature see box data from observational trialsinitial support for hrt the role for estrogen replacement therapy ert and hormone replace ment therapy was initially supported by numerous observational epide miological studies a metaanalysis of these initial studies published from through the s showed a signiﬁ cant reduction in risk of chd in women taking hrt based on these observational data the use of hrtert in the primary and secondary prevention of chd in women was the standard of care until when results from large randomized controlled trials rcts contradicted the ﬁ ndings of earlier observational studies data from randomized controlled trialsincreased risk with hrt in primary and secondary prevention when hrt was evaluated in a large randomized controlled study in post menopausal women with known chd hers trial there was no differ ence in recurrent chd events between the placebo group and the hrt box effects of estrogen alteration in lipoprotein proﬁ le decrease in total cholesterol ldlc and lpa increase in hdlc and triglycerides regulate expression of ﬁ brinogen and atiii and protein s rapid effects on vasculature vasodilation and increased nitric oxide no synthesis longterm effects on vasculature alterations in gene expressions that decrease atherosclerosis decrease vascular injury decrease smooth muscle cell growth and increase endothelial cell growth proinﬂ ammatory increase in creactive protein crp women and heart disease group in fact a posthoc time trend analysis showed a increase in chd events during the ﬁ rst year of hrt use compared to placebo and a trend toward a decrease in chd events in years and further stud ies looking at the beneﬁ t of estrogen replacement therapy alone in the secondary prevention of chd also did not show a beneﬁ t in reducing cardiac events similarly a large randomized controlled trial of hrt in the primary pre vention of chd in postmenopausal women womens health initiative did not show a reduction in chd events in fact there was a trend toward an increase in chd events with the greatest amount of risk occurring in the ﬁ rst year after randomization with a hazard ratio of ci interestingly a subgroup analysis of women stratiﬁ ed according to years since menopause revealed a nonsigniﬁ cant trend toward a reduction in chd in women less than years since menopause hr ci when estrogen replacement alone was evaluated in the primary prevention of chd there was also no signiﬁ cant difference in chd events between the active treatment arm and the placebo possible future role for hrt in prevention of chd regardless of the type of estrogen used the method of hormone delivery or the combination of hormone replacement with estrogen and progestin no signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t in chd prevention was found in the aforementioned randomized trials in the randomized trials however the average time between menopause and enrollment in the studies ranged from years to over years the initiation of hormone or estrogen therapy at this late stage may not truly represent physiological replacement and may contribute to lack of beneﬁ t in both primary and secondary prevention of chd the delay in hrtert may have allowed subclinical atherosclerosis to develop and may have reduced the cardiovascular beneﬁ ts of estrogen the trend toward a reduction in chd events in the subgroup analysis in the womens health initiative of women who began hrtert within years of menopause and results from a series of experiments in primates which showed a beneﬁ t of ert on atherogenesis progression only when started immediately postoophorectomy lend support to this theory these observations have kept the door open for a possible role of hrt in primary prevention in women at the inception of menopause and are the basis for the ongoing kronos early estrogen prevention study keeps for now however there is no clear role of hrt or ert for either primary or secondary prevention of chd in postmenopausal women dietary and vitamin supplements role of antioxidant vitamin supplements in women as with the debate over hrt in the primary and secondary prevention of chd in women the role of antioxidant vitamins has been investigated over the past two decades like estrogen vitamin e had a plausible biologi cal basis for a postulated role in atherosclerosis prevention this theory was based on the hypothesis that oxidative modiﬁ cation of lowdensity lipoprotein ldl initiates atherosclerosis and on the idea that chapter special populations women and elderly antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin e could inhibit lipid peroxidation thereby preventing the development or progression of atherosclerosis and chd observational data from the nurses health study and iowa womens study initially supported this hypothesis however the positive beneﬁ t of vitamin e supplements noted in observational studies has not been con sistently supported by subsequent randomized placebocontrolled clinical trials the gissiprevenzione trial the heart protection study hps and the wave trial found no beneﬁ t of vitamin e in the secondary prevention of chd events or in the angiographic progression of coronary atheroscle rosis the ability to apply these results to a female population however is limited because of the low proportion of women in gissi in hps in the majority of these trials similarly data for the role of vitamin e supplements in the primary pre vention of chd in women have also not been borne out in randomized placebocontrolled studies in subgroup analyses of the hope and hope too trials there was no reduction in chd events in women assigned to vitamin e supplementation however a study dedicated to addressing this issue in women the womens health study found a nonsigniﬁ cant reduction in major car diovascular events nonfatal mi nonfatal stroke cardiovascular death and a signiﬁ cant reduction in major cardiovascular events in the subgroup of women aged years or older suggesting a possible role in the primary prevention of chd events in this elderly subset of women the use of vitamin e in this subgroup of women needs to be investigated further while data regarding the use of antioxidant vitamins speciﬁ cally vitamin e in the primary and secondary prevention of chd have been contradic tory the bulk of the data does not support the use of vitamin e in the prevention of chd in women at this point in time vitamin e should not be recommended for the primary or secondary prevention of chd in women role of folic acid or vitamin b in chd prevention in women plasma homocysteine levels have been shown to be a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular disease in both men and women the correla tion between homocysteine and chd mortality r suggests that homocysteine may play an important role in determining chd mortality among different populations several plausible mechanisms by which homocysteine could increase risk of chd direct toxicity to endothelial cells increased coagulation decreased endothelial reactivity and stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation have been previously elucidated folate and vitamin b are important cofactors in the metabolism of homocysteine and changing the intake of folic acid and vitamin b can modify homocysteine levels accordingly studies have shown that low dietary intake of vitamin b is also associated with increased risk of chd based on these observations some investigators have hypothesized that lowering levels of homocysteine via folate and vitamin b supplementa tion would translate into a reduction in cardiovascular events support for this hypothesis in women was initially offered from observations from the women and heart disease nurses health study which showed a relationship between folate and b intake and incidence of chd events the concern that the observed relation of homocysteine and vitamin bfolate to chd risk may actually represent unrecognized confounders rather than a true causal relationship has led to the development of rand omized clinical trials similar to the hrt and vitamin e story randomized controlled studies evaluating the role of vitamin b and folate in the sec ondary prevention of chd have been negative norvit trial the role of these vitamins in the primary prevention of chd however is still a question until a randomized clinical trial addresses this issue the routine use of these supplements in primary prevention of chd in women is not recommended role of omega fatty acid supplements the observation that populations with a high intake of ﬁ sh have a lower rate of cardiovascular disease initially led to the hypothesis that ﬁ sh con sumption may have a protective effect for atherosclerosis box several prospective epidemiological studies in men have lent support to this hypothesis similar risk reductions were also observed in women in the nurses health study cohort although these epidemiological data are compelling to date there are no randomized controlled clinical trials to support the role of ﬁ sh or ﬁ sh oil in the primary prevention of chd events in women currently the jelis investigators are following postmenopausal women and men who were free of chd in a trial of eicosapentae noic acid epa a component of ﬁ sh oil in addition to treatment with a statin in hyperlipidemic patients for years the primary end points in this trial are major coronary events sudden cardiac death fatal and nonfatal mi unstable angina and coronary revascularization the initial results of this trial which were presented at the american heart association scientiﬁ c session in revealed a risk reduction in major cardiovascular events rr ci in the group treated with epa plus statin therapy compared to statin therapy alone and a risk reduction in unstable angina rr ci in contrast to the dearth of data from randomized controlled trials on the role of ﬁ sh oil in the primary prevention of chd there have been sev eral observational trials and randomized controlled clinical trials showing box proposed biological mechanisms for omega fatty acid cv protective effects reduced susceptibility of the heart to ventricular arrhythmias antithrombogenic properties lowering of triglyceride levels retardation of atherosclerotic plaque growth via reduced adhesion molecule expression reduction in platelet derived growth factor antiinﬂ ammatory mediator promotion of noinduced endothelial relaxation chapter special populations women and elderly a beneﬁ t of ﬁ sh oil on the secondary prevention of chd events gissi prevenzione trial the low number of female subjects participating in these trials however limits the applicability of the results to women although the data are limited in women at this time it is reasonable to recommend the use of n omega fatty acids for the secondary preven tion of chd events in women who have recently had an mi the recent results from the jelis study also support the recommendation of adding ﬁ sh oil to the treatment of hyperlipidemics in the primary prevention of chd events aspirin use in women aspirin for primary prevention in women the role of aspirin in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is well established in both men and women the role of aspirin in the pri mary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women on the other hand is not clear the physicians health study which was the ﬁ rst trial to uncover a sig niﬁ cant reduction in ﬁ rst mi with aspirin use only included men in its subject population the data from the hypertension optimal treatment study hot and the primary prevention project each trial included about women present a less than convincing argument for the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of mi in women the womens health study sought to ﬁ nally answer this question in women this study enrolled women who were free of cardiovas cular disease and had lowrisk cardiovascular proﬁ les the investigators found a nonsigniﬁ cant risk reduction in major cardiovascular events with no signiﬁ cant effect on fatal or nonfatal mi and with a concomitant increase in the rate of bleeding complications in those taking aspirin only in the subgroup of women over the age of did they ﬁ nd a signiﬁ cant reduction in major cardiovascular events and in mi event rate based on these data there does not appear to be a clear role for aspi rin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women in the lowrisk female population there may be a beneﬁ t in the elderly female population however given the risk of bleeding complications this needs to be fur ther evaluated with a largescale trial dedicated to answering this question although there is no clear role of aspirin use in the primary prevention of chd events in women this does not negate its use in women with estab lished coronary artery disease especially in the setting of acute myocardial infarction or postangioplasty and stenting cholesterol and inﬂ ammatory biomarkers of chd in women optimal lipid levels in women for secondary prevention of chd the role of ldl cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis has been well established however the best lipid parameter for predicting chd events in women continues to be an issue of some debate in a nested casecontrol study from the nurses health study cohort the data suggest that measurements of both ldl and hdl are essential in the prediction of chd events in women women and heart disease a similar contribution to the prediction model was seen when the ratio of total cholesterol to hdl was added roc increased to this ratio reﬂ ects the proportion of atherogenictoantiatherogenic lipid fractions and appears to be a powerful tool for predicting chd in postmenopausal women from these data it follows that lowering ldl cholesterol and rais ing hdl cholesterol should play a role in chd prevention in women accordingly the data from secondary prevention randomized controlled trials of statin therapy have shown reduced risks of chd events in women placed on statin therapy the female subgroup analyses of the s trial the care trial and the proveittimi trial have all shown signiﬁ cant reductions in major coronary events in women with known cad who are placed on statins based on observational and clinical trial data the goal ldl in women with a history of chd or diabetes should be d mgdl role of crp in predicting chd risk in women in addition to ldl and hdl cholesterol recent data have shown that vari ous markers of inﬂ ammation are also potent predictors of chd events in women women in general have higher crp levels than those in men and black women have signiﬁ cantly higher crp levels than white hispanic or asian women these higher crp levels may provide insight into the pathogenesis of angina in women with nonobstructive coronary disease and further aid in assessing chd risk in women using the womens health study cohort women both crp and ldl were identiﬁ ed as strong independent predictors of cardiovascular events each measurement identifying different highrisk groups screening for both markers provided better information than either measurement alone in fact of ﬁ rst cardiovascular events occurred in women with an ldl mgdl and occurred in women with ldl mgdl the addition of crp measurements would have helped to identify atrisk women that were missed by the standards set by the national cholesterol education program the jupiter trial a prospective randomized controlled study of the use of rosuvastatin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with low ldl cholesterol levels mgdl and elevated crp levels t mgl has recently conﬁ rmed these observational data by tar geting women with elevated crp even in the absence of signiﬁ cant ldl elevation we will be able to identify more women who are at risk of chd and be able to aggressively treat them with statin therapy chapter special populations women and elderly the elderly and heart disease coronary heart disease chd coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states in patients older than years of age patients over the age of account for greater than of all myocardial infarctions cabg procedures and about of all percutaneous coronary interventions as the life expectancy of americans continues to increase the popula tion at risk for chd and its complications will also increase it is therefore imperative to pursue aggressive primary and secondary prevention meas ures in these patients to determine any unique interaction or considera tions for this group and to establish standard preventive and therapeutic strategies in this growing segment of the american population treatment of dyslipidemia in the elderly given that the absolute risk for chd increases with age the absolute numbers of people beneﬁ ting from cholesterol lowering is greater in the elderly patient population as with a younger patient cohort total choles terol low hdlc and high ldlc have all been shown to be signiﬁ cant risk factors for chd in the elderly although it was previously thought that it would take several years to see a potential beneﬁ t from statin therapy on the course atherosclerosis there fore limiting its use in an elderly population it has now been shown that the clinical beneﬁ ts of statins can be seen as early as months and that they can improve endothelial dysfunction within days of initiating therapy the secondary prevention trials of ldlclowering therapies have shown signiﬁ cant reductions in cardiac events in the studied populations the applica bility of these results however to an elderly patient population is somewhat limited secondary to the small number of elderly subjects in these studies in subgroup analyses of the studies that did include elderly patients there does appear to be a similar beneﬁ t to lipid lowering in this cohort of elderly patients to that for younger patients see table similarly the limited data available for the use of statins in the primary prevention of chd in the elderly also supports its use in this group currently lipidlowering therapy is markedly underused in the elderly in the absence of other contraindications lipidlowering therapy should be initiated in the elderly following the same atp iii guidelines used to guide therapy in a younger patient population treatment of hypertension in the elderly similar to dyslipidemia hypertension htn is a common problem in the elderly with a prevalence of over in patients over the age of years there is a large body of literature supporting the beneﬁ t of treating htn in the elderly including patients over the age of years in a metaanalysis of trials of treatment of isolated systolic htn it was found that only patients over the age of would need to be treated for years in order to prevent one cardiovascular event when initiating antihypertensive therapy in the elderly there may be several potential limiting factors namely posturalpostprandial hypo tension and sluggish baroreceptor and sympathetic nervous system the elderly and heart disease table lipidlowering therapy in those over years old study no of elderly subjects results s subjects years old lower allcause mortality lower chd mortality lower mace lower revascularization procedures care subjects between and years old for every elderly patients treated cv hospitalizations and cv events were prevented lipid subjects between and years old absolute beneﬁ t was greater in the elderly compared to the younger patients fewer patients needed to be treated to prevent a death mi or stroke hps k patients age years old similar reduction in cv events in patients above and below age cards na reduction in ﬁ rst cv event in subjects older than years responsiveness as well as impaired cerebral autoregulation which neces sitates cautious initiation of therapy to prevent or minimize ischemic and orthostatic side effects see box therefore when starting antihypertensive therapy lower initial doses should be used about onehalf the dose used in younger patients valvular heart disease in the elderly aortic stenosis calciﬁ c or degenerative aortic valve disease is the most common valvular abnormality seen in the elderly the prevalence of at least moderate aortic stenosis ava cm in patients aged years old was in the helsinki aging study currently the recommendations for aortic valve placement in aortic stenosis are the same as in the younger patient population namely devel opment of symptoms severe as in patients undergoing cabg or other valve surgery or severe as with lvef however when considering aortic valve replacement in the elderly it is important to note that elderly patients typically have poorer preop erative status than that of younger patients leading to higher inhospital box antihypertensive therapy in the elderly first line thiazide diuretics second line ace inhibitorarb or longacting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker ie amlodipine b blockers should not be used as primary therapy for hypertension in the elderly in the absence of another speciﬁ c indication ie prior mi or chf chapter special populations women and elderly mortality ranging between and in various studies with age being a very important determinant of outcome elderly patients also have more nonfatal complications and longer peri operative hospitalizations than a younger patient cohort however if the elderly patient survives the perioperative period the patient typically does very well with good longterm survival and signiﬁ cant improvement in symp toms similar survival to the general population of agematched subjects therefore more and more elderly patients are being considered for aortic valve surgery as surgical and supportive techniques continue to improve in addition for patients who are considered too high a risk for surgical correction percutaneous aortic valve replacement techniques are cur rently being developed in europe and south america and may eventually be a viable alternative therapy in the elderly patient population aortic regurgitation aortic regurgitation is less common in the elderly than calciﬁ c aortic ste nosis or mitral regurgitation and is most often associated with aortic ste nosis or dilation of the ascending aorta from longstanding hypertension although prophylactic aortic valve surgery is usually recommended for asymptomatic patients with severe aortic insufﬁ ciency ai and evidence of lv dysfunction in the elderly especially patients over the age of it is recommended that aortic valve surgery be reserved for those patients with symptoms and severe ai given the increased risk of operative and longterm mortality with increasing age mitral regurgitation mitral regurgitation mr is the second most common indication for valve surgery in the elderly accounting for of cases myxomatous degeneration of the valve and ischemic heart disease are the two most common etiologies of mitral regurgitation in this patient population similar to aortic regurgitation it is preferable to refer patients over the age of for mitral valve surgery only if they are symptomatic as the day mor tality in patients over the age of is with mitral valve replacement the outcome after surgery varies on the basis of patient age comor bidites and disease severity and is improved with mitral valve repair com pared to replacement in addition it has been shown that functional mr secondary to ischemia may improve signiﬁ cantly with cabg alone thereby simplifying any potential procedure in this higherrisk patient population mitral stenosis mitral stenosis remains a disease primarily of younger patients with rheu matic heart disease being the most common etiology in elderly patients the most common cause of mitral stenosis is impingement on the mitral valve by mitral annular calciﬁ cation the preferred surgical treatment for mitral stenosis is mitral commis surotomy however this is often not possible in the elderly necessitating mitral valve replacement the ideal treatment for those elderly patients with favorable valvular morphology is percutaneous valvotomy however the number of eld erly patients who have valvular morphology amenable to this technique is quite limited chapter lead ecg and rhythm a ace
