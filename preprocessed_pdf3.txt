website referenced in this work v im always full of awe for the herculean efforts of the authors when asked to write a foreword to a book the long hours that the authors of the oxford handbook of respiratory medicine put into the first edition published in have been compensated by the books clear value and popularity since research has increased our understanding of respiratory dis ease particularly in the areas of airway disease lung cancer and interstitial lung disease large robust clinical trials have also informed our clinical prac tice and there have been subsequent modifications in national and interna tional guidelines to reflect these our practice on the respiratory ward and clinic has been influenced as a result nationally the burden of respiratory disease is being increasingly recog nised the government responses to the harmful effects of cigarette smoke currently focused on banning smoking in cars carrying children and con sidering plain packaging for cigarettes highlight the ongoing prominence of smoking in respiratory health this third edition reflects many of these updates and changes and is therefore a reliable and useful information source the same authors across the three editions bring consistency and reflects admirable stamina and the need to keep it user friendly for the respiratory trainee has been recog nised and a new author has been added to provide a trainees perspective ian pavord ma dm frcp professor of respiratory medicine ndm research building university of oxford this respiratory medicine handbook provides reliable and uptodate information for the respiratory trainee its format is designed so that infor mation is easily accessible and practical with useful tips for investigation and management in the outpatient clinic and the ward it summarizes the most recent guidelines from the british thoracic society when applicable in each chapter along with a detailed discussion of each condition perti nent research and common practice as such it could be used as a learning resource when preparing for the mrcp speciality certificate examination in respiratory medicine or other respiratory assessments the practical procedures section is particularly useful with stepbystep how to guides for all procedures encountered by the trainee such as pleural aspiration chest drains thoracoscopy and bronchoscopy dr adam hill consultant respiratory physician and honorary reader royal infirmary of edinburgh specialist advisory committee chair respiratory associate pg dean se scotland quality management forewords vi this handbook of respiratory medicine has been written largely by special ist registrars for specialist registrars three of the four authors stephen chapman grace robinson and sophie west are specialist registrars on the oxford rotation and john stradling is professor of respiratory medicine in oxford it is in a format that the authors would like to have had when they started their specialist registrar training however we hope that any health worker or student with an interest in respiratory medicine will find this text a rapid and useful reference source the layout of the book tries to fulfil the requirement to be able to look up a topic quickly when the clinical need arises but also to provide a bit more insight into the more difficult areas therefore the chapters are of necessity different in style and reflect the authors own views on how to best approach and understand an area the handbook is divided into five sections clinical presentations and approaches to symptoms and problems the clinical conditions themselves supportive information procedures and useful appendices also on the inside covers containing more technical and reference information we hope you find it helpful feedback on errors and omissions would be much appreciated please post your comments via the oup website m httpwwwoupcomukmedicinehandbooks june the second edition of this book has allowed us to make several improve ments in response to readers suggestions we have changed the order of chapters within each section to alphabetical and improved the index to make the contents more rapidly accessible we have added new content such as more detailed radiology pandemic influenza and pulmonary com plications of sickle cell disease in addition we have updated and enhanced topics where there have been new guidelines and relevant publications the overall aim of the book to provide a rapid and comprehensive resource for all those involved in respiratory medicine has remained paramount october the third edition has allowed us to review and update all the existing chap ters and include new clinical guidelines and significant research new sec tions on thoracic ultrasound and indwelling pleural catheters reflect changes in routine clinical practice since the previous editions there are also new chapters on safe sedation and cardiopulmonary exercise testing we wel come the contribution of our new coauthor john wrightson who has helped maintain the specialist registrar perspective september prefaces vii we would like to offer our grateful thanks to the following friends

duration and onset of breathlessness box groups the causes of breathlessness by speed of onset although in practice some variability and overlap exist patients often underestimate the duration of symptomsenquiring about exercise tolerance over a period of time is a useful way of assessing duration and progression severity of breathlessness assess the level of handicap and disability by asking about effects on lifestyle work and daily activities exacerbating factors ask about rest and exertion nocturnal symptoms and body position the timing of nocturnal breathlessness may provide clues to

coexist chapter chest pain introduction to chest pain acute pleuritic chest pain chronic chest pain chapter chest pain introduction to chest pain the majority of patients with chest pain referred for a respiratory opinion have either acute pleuritic pain or persistent welllocalized pain cardiac pain rarely presents in this manner although it should be considered in exer tional pain or in the presence of risk factors for ischaemic heart disease within the respiratory system pain may arise from the parietal pleura major airways chest wall diaphragm and mediastinum the lung parenchyma and visceral pleura are insensitive to pain processes involving the upper parietal pleura cause a pain localized to that part of the chest the lower parietal pleura and outer region of the diaphragmatic pleura are innervated by the lower six intercostal nerves and pain here may be referred to the abdo men the central region of the diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerve c and and pain may be referred to the ipsilateral shoulder tip tracheobronchitis tends to be associated with retrosternal pain acute pleuritic chest pain acute pleuritic chest pain pleuritic pain is sharp well localized worse on coughing and inspiration and the subsequent limitation of inspiration often leads to a degree of breathlessness causes of acute pleuritic chest pain include pulmonary infarction following

addition consider atypical presentations of serious conditions such as mi aortic dissection oesophageal rupture and pancreatitis consider angioinvasive fungi such as aspergillus as a cause of pleuritic chest pain in the immunocompromised diagnosis is typically based on pattern recognition of clinical features followed by selected investigations initial investigations typically include cxr

pleuritic pain and exclusion of this diagnosis is the usual reason for referral assess risk factors for thromboembolic disease normal o saturations and pao in the normal range do not exclude the diagnosis calculate the aa gradient see e p the presence of a pleural rub is a nonspecific sign that occurs with pleural inflammation of any cause in young adults pneumococcal pneumonia may present with acuteonset pleuritic chest pain although systemic symptoms such as fever usually predate the pain by hours the pain from pericarditis is pleuritic but central and relieved on leaning forward there may also be a pericardial rub characteristic ecg features and a small pericardial effusion on echo musculoskeletal pain may occur as a result of cervical disc disease arthritis of the shoulder or spine a fractured rib or costochondritis tietzes syndrome which often follows a viral infection the presence of chest wall tenderness does not invariably indicate a benign musculoskeletal cause

obstruction there may be typical asthmatic diurnal peak flow variability of or peak flows may be stable methacholine challenge should be positive for asthma but does not rule out a steroidresponsive cough if negative other causes of cough should be sought treatment should be for at least months with highdose inhaled steroids response may take days or weeks bronchodilators may make little difference if inhaled steroid therapy has been tried unsuccessfully ensure inhaler technique is optimal and a high dose has been used alternatively prescribe a week course of oral prednisolone mg day and assess response if the cough improves highdose inhaled steroids should be continued and slowly reduced after about months there is a small trial showing leukotriene receptor antagonists decreased

eosinophilia improves with inhaled corticosteroids usually after weeks or trial of oral prednisolone sputum eosinophil count also reduces with treatment if there is no response the cough is unlikely to be due to eosinophilic airway inflammation gord cough may be related to distal reflux at the lower oesophageal sphincter los or due to microaspiration of acid into the trachea there may be associated oesophageal dysmotility los reflux is often longstanding and is associated with a productive or nonproductive daytime cough and mini mal nocturnal symptoms it is worse after meals and when sitting down due to increased intraabdominal pressure being transmitted to the los microaspiration is associated with more prominent symptoms of reflux or dyspepsia although these are not always present patients may have an intermittent hoarse voice dysphonia and sore throat cough may be the only symptom of reflux causes of chronic cough asthma gord laryngoscopy may reveal posterior vocal cord inflammation but this is not a reliable sign a trial of treatment for both is recommended this is with a highdose pro ton pump inhibitor ppi for at least usually months although longer treatment may be required to control cough h receptor blockers are also effective and prokinetics like metoclopramide may help as an addition if cough improves but has not gone completely other reflux avoidance

rhinitis is defined as sneezing nasal discharge or blockage for h on most days for either a limited part of the year seasonal or all year perennial rhinitis may be allergic eg hay fever nonallergic or infective the associ ated nasal inflammation may irritate cough receptors directly or produce a postnasal drip these secretions may pool at the back of the throat giving a sensation of liquid dripping into the back of the throat which requires frequent throat clearing or drip directly into the trachea initiating cough there may be frequent nasal discharge a history of facial pain and purulent nasal discharge suggests sinusitis which can also predispose to postnasal drip symptoms of cough can occur on lying but can be constant regardless of position rhinosinusitis describes inflammation and infection within the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses with chronic rhinosinusitis defined as symptoms persisting for more than weeks ent examination may reveal swollen turbinates cobblestone naso pharyngeal mucosa nasal discharge or nasal polyps treatment nasal preparations should be taken by kneeling with the top of the head on the floor mecca position or lying supine with the head tipped over the end of the bed improvements in cough should be found within weeks duration of treatment is unclear nonallergic rhinitis trials suggest the best results are with an initial weeks of nasal decongestants with firstgeneration antihistamines which have helpful anticholinergic properties and pseudoephedrine alternatives are nasal ipratropium bromide or xylometazoline this is then followed by months of highdose nasal steroids which are ineffective when used as firstline treatment secondgeneration antihistamines ie nonsedating are of no use in nonallergic rhinitis allergic rhinitis secondgeneration oral antihistamine eg cetirizine loratadine fexofenadine and highdose nasal steroids for months at least vasomotor rhinitis nasal ipratropium bromide for months nasal steroids may also have a role chronic rhinosinusitis nasal steroids and saline lavage which should have an effect by weeks and if so treatment should continue although optimal duration unclear sinusitis is an infection of the paranasal sinuses which may compli cate an urti and is frequently caused by haemophilus h influenzae or causes of chronic cough streptococcus s pneumoniae it causes frontal headache and facial pain chronic sinusitis may require further investigation with cxr or ct which shows mucosal thickening and airfluid levels surgery may be indicated chronic sinusitis treat as for nonallergic rhinitis but include weeks of antibiotics active against h influenzae such as doxycycline or coamoxiclav postinfectious respiratory tract infections especially if viral in nature can cause cough this may take weeks or months to resolve spontaneously although most settle within weeks there may be a postnasal drip con tribution the cough is related to a heightened cough reflex associated laryngospasm can occur which is a sudden hoarseness with associated stridulous inspiratory efforts and a sensation of being unable to breathe treatment with antitussives such as codeine linctus may

investigations diffuse lung disease presenting with acute respiratory failure chapter chapter diffuse lung disease causes diffuse lung disease is common and its diagnosis is frequently challenging this chapter describes a diagnostic approach based on clinical features imaging and other investigations more detailed descriptions of the diseases themselves are presented later in the book the term diffuse lung disease is used here to describe any widespread pulmonary disease process patients typically present with breathlessness and bilateral cxr shadowing the rate of onset and severity of breathlessness are extremely variable however and presentations range from an asymptomatic patient with longstanding radiological changes to an acute onset of breathlessness over a period of days leading rapidly to respiratory failure and death anatomy of diffuse lung disease an understanding of lung anatomy is helpful when considering the causes of diffuse lung disease and their appearance on hrct many diffuse lung diseases primarily affect the interstitium interstitial lung disease also described as diffuse parenchymal lung disease a poorly defined term that refers to the connective tissue fibrous framework of the lung centrally connective tissue surrounds bronchovascular bundles each consisting of a bronchus and its accompanying pulmonary artery that originate at the hila peripherally these connective tissue sheaths are in continuity with fibrous interlobular septa which organize the lung into units called pulmonary lobules polyhedral structures with approximately cm sides see fig a e p interlobular septa which define and separate pulmonary lobules contain lymphatics and venules a pulmonary lobule contains around acini and is supplied at its centre by a bronchiole and pulmo nary arteriole the term interstitial lung disease is potentially confusing because many primarily interstitial processes also involve the airways vasculature and alveolar airspaces disease processes that primarily affect the airways eg bronchiectasis vessels eg vasculitis or airspaces eg pneumonia may also present with diffuse cxr shadowing causes there are several hundred causes of

chapter sleep and ventilation history the problem sleep apnoea and related problems are now a common reason for referral to many respiratory units this is due to much better recognition of the syndromes and the increasing prevalence of obesity in the general population respiratory units with sleep services are seeing increasing numbers of patients primarily for possible osa and therefore most patients tend to be sleepy and referrals for insomnia are not usually encouraged patients arrive at a respiratory sleep unit for several different reasons they are commonly concerns that the patient may have sleep apnoea with or without a full house of symptoms concerns that an obese individual may have obesity hypoventilation loud snoring with the patient or spouse seeking advice about noise reduction referrals from the ent department who may be considering offering surgery for snoring and wish to exclude osa first excessive daytime sleepiness diagnosis unclear might just be osa might be narcolepsy etc assessment prebariatric surgery as prevalence of osa very high other nocturnal symptoms such as sleepwalking panic arousals etc thus in sleep outpatients the issues revolve around making the correct diagnosis of the excessive daytime sleepiness or nocturnal symptoms and referring on if appropriate offering simple advice for snoring or putting the patient through the cpap induction programme some units perform a sleep study first on the basis of an appropriate referral letter as it is more efficient others see the patient first and then book a sleep study if indicated usually are studied for the purposes of this account it is assumed that the patient is seen first history a clear history of the exact presenting complaint is obviously necessary concentrating on the

symptom severity vs the perceived inconvenience of the treatment recent evidence suggests that even relatively asympto matic patients with osa presenting to a sleep clinic may benefit from a trial of cpap thus to quote if in doubt blow up the snout however an abnormal sleep study is rarely a reason in its own right for cpap weight loss works but is rarely achievable other causes must not be missed

physicians role is to dissuade the patient from this route as the objective success rate is poor and the hazards significant the presence of significant osa is a contraindication to surgery all other

hyperoxia and nosocomial infections mechanical ventilation with peep and high inflation pressures are almost always required to maintain oxygenation sao values in the low s are entirely adequate there is evidence that high inflation pressures may worsen ards directly microbarotrauma therefore try to maintain plateau pressures cmho many ventilation strategies have been tried to reduce the high inflation pressures that result from the stiff lungs low compliance for example using low tidal volume ventilation to reduce inflation pressures mlkg ideal body weight compared with mlkg reduces mortality by and increases ventilatorfree days use of high peep attempt to open collapsed alveoli has been shown in a metaanalysis to improve oxygenation and decrease time on a ventilator and is associated with a lower itu mortal ity for patients with paofio mmhg kpa reducing the minute ventilation and allowing the paco to rise permissive hypercapnia also reduces the inflation pressures prone ventilation has been tried in an attempt to improve vq match ing and initial increases in pao are observed a metaanalysis suggested a possible survival advantage for those with severe hypoxia and a recent rct has shown a significant reduction in both and day mortality for patients with severe ards several different artificial surfactants have been tried to try and improve lung compliance although good delivery to the abnormal areas is unlikely although effective in animal models the rcts have been negative in humans haemodynamic monitoring guided by central venous catheters has a similar efficacy to pulmonary artery catheters but are associated with a reduction in catheterrelated complications mostly arrhythmias different degrees of hydration have been compared with reduced fluid balances improving gas exchange and shortening duration of mechanical ventilation secondary analysis of a cohort study suggested that a negative day fluid balance is associated with decreased mortality although this was not confirmed in a randomized study highdose steroids have been used but there is evidence of harm as well as benefit and minimal evidence of overall improved survival three metaanalyses failed to demonstrate significant mortality improvements while one showed decreased mortality certain subgroups may do slightly better and others worse eg steroids are possibly beneficial during the first days but detrimental thereafter a rct using prolonged methyl prednisolone infusion mgkgday for early ards h showed improvement in a number of outcomes and halved mortality but this was a small study n and patient characteristics were imbalanced in the treatment arms management and complications extracorporeal membrane oxygenationco removal will buy time and allow the lung to rest but these techniques are very expensive and it is difficult to demonstrate any longterm benefit complications of ards include the high ventilation pressures lead to barotrauma pneumothorax surgical emphysema pneumomediastinum pneumothorax may be lethal but difficult to detect on a cxr in the supine patient nosocomial infections occur in about half the patients making surveillance minibals important myopathy associated with longterm neuromuscular blockade high steroid doses and poor glycaemic control nonspecific problems of vte gi haemorrhage inadequate nutrition prognosis has improved over the last y probably due to improvements in supportive care and ventilator strategies rather than an ability to modify the inflammatory process and its subsequent repair prognosis is worse with intrapulmonary causes early deaths are usually due to the precipitating condition and later deaths to complications over half of the patients will survive with varying residual lung damage although the pfts often show only minor restrictive abnormalities and reduced kco indicating the considerable capacity of the lung to recover a prospective cohort study showed that minute walking test mwt distance remained decreased at predicted even at y future developments the optimal level of peep in a particular patient is difficult to predict inadequate peep allows more atelectasis but too high peep contributes to overdistension of remaining alveoli and further barotrauma when there are no more recruitable alveoli ways to estimate the best peep are under investigation highfrequency oscillatory ventilation hfov has been around a long while but the recent oscillate and oscar randomized trials suggested a lack of benefit with possible harm associated with its use recently liquid ventilation with perfluorochemicals has been tried these dense ocarrying liquids reduce the heterogeneity of ventilation by nullifying the requirement for surfactant thus recruiting the collapsed alveoli there are improvements in oxygenation but no evidence yet of clinically meaningful outcomes nitric oxide no has been tried with clear improvements in oxygenation but very little effect on survival the mode of action is not clear and may be more than just vasodilatation inhaled prostacyclin is similarly unconvincing antiinflammatory and antioxidant therapies are still very much in the experimental phase off the shelf artificial lung systems are now becoming clinically useful to buy time while the lungs recover the novalung interventional lung assist device is an example but such therapy is very expensive chapter asbestos and the lung asbestos benign asbestosrelated pleural disease asbestosis mesothelioma diagnosis mesothelioma treatment and outcome compensation for asbestosrelated diseases chapter asbestos and the lung asbestos asbestos consists of a family of naturally occurring hydrated silicate fibres that may be subdivided into two groups curly serpentine fibres of which chrysotile white is the only fibre currently in commercial use straight needlelike amphiboles which comprise crocidolite blue amosite brown anthophyllite tremolite and actinolite fibres have a predisposition to localize to the pleura they differ in their lung clearance kinetics and pathogenic potential amphibole fibres clear more slowly from the lung and are more carcinogenic than chrysotile whilst asbestos usage in developed countries is restricted the use of chry sotile asbestos in developing economies continues to rise mechanisms of exposure occupational exposure accounts for the majority of cases of asbestosrelated disease and includes mining milling and transport of asbestos use of asbestos products eg in construction and demolition floor tiling insulation fireproofing textiles friction materials brake linings ship building pipefitting electrical repair boiler fitting and lagging carpentry plumbing and welding domestic exposure may include relatives of asbestos workers exposed to carry home asbestos in hair or clothes following remodelling or renovation in contaminated buildings local geological exposure from natural deposits eg areas of central and southeast turkey northwest greece and corsica urban environment although undisturbed and nonfriable asbestos building insulation is not considered hazardous a complete occupational history is essential if asbestosrelated disease is suspected and should include the method of exposure with dates and names of employers this information may be of medicolegal importance and ideally should be elicited during the first consultation asbestosrelated lung disease comprises benign asbestosrelated pleural disease pleural plaques benign asbestosrelated pleural effusion diffuse pleural thickening rounded atelectasis asbestosis mesothelioma lung cancer multiplicative risk from smoking other diseases linked to asbestos exposure include pericarditis and per haps head and neck and gi cancers whether asbestos exposure truly leads to an increased risk of lung cancer in the absence of asbestosis remains controversial asbestos asbestosrelated disease typically exhibits a long latency period of y from exposure peak industrial asbestos use in the uk occurred in the early s and asbestosrelated disease is likely to remain common for at least the next y the incidence of mesothelioma is forecast to peak in in europe all deaths should be notified to the coroner if asbestosrelated disease is suspected or proven chapter asbestos and the lung benign asbestosrelated pleural disease pleural plaques most common manifestation of asbestos exposure discrete areas of white or yellow thickening on the parietal pleura may calcify histologically these are acellular avascular areas of hyaline collagen fibrosis bilateral and occur particularly on the posterolateral chest wall particularly adjacent to ribs over the mediastinal pleura and on the dome of the diaphragm but are absent in the costophrenic angles develop y after exposure incidence but not the extent of plaques increases with longer duration of exposure found in up to of asbestosexposed workers and may also occur after lowdose exposures usually asymptomatic although if extensive may be associated with mild breathlessness due to pleural restriction effect on pulmonary function is uncertain most studies have failed to demonstrate abnormal lung function although otherwise unexplained mild airways obstruction or restriction has been described in some populations of asbestos workers with pleural plaquesthe mechanism of this is unclear although it may reflect asbestosinduced small airway disease or early interstitial fibrosis respectively hrct is more sensitive than cxr in detecting pleural plaques there is no evidence that plaques are premalignant asymptomatic plaques are no longer eligible for compensation in england and wales but are in scotland and northern ireland see e pp tb trauma and haemothorax may each cause single pleural plaques multiple plaques are highly suggestive of asbestos exposure benign asbestosrelated pleural effusions relatively early manifestation of asbestos pleural disease

associated with pleuritic pain fever and dyspnoea usually resolve spontaneously over a few months although some recur the pleural effusion is an exudate often bloodstained with no characteristic findings on pleural fluid analysis diagnosis depends on a history of asbestos exposure and the exclusion of other causes including mesothelioma benign asbestos pleurisy may precede the development of diffuse pleural thickening there is no clear association with mesothelioma treat symptomatically with pleural aspiration for breathlessness and nsaids for pain benign asbestosrelated pleural disease diffuse pleural thickening dpt consists of extensive fibrosis of the visceral pleura with areas of adhesion with the parietal pleura and consequent obliteration of the pleural space unlike pleural plaques its margins are illdefined and it may involve the costophrenic angles apices and interlobar fissures development appears to be doserelated and may follow recurrent asbestos pleurisy on cxr it may be defined as a smooth uninterrupted pleural opacity extending over at least a quarter of the chest wall with or without obliteration of the costophrenic angles on ct the pleural density extends cm craniocaudally cm laterally and is mm thick symptoms are relatively common and comprise exertional breathlessness and chest pain which can be chronic and severe may lead to significant restrictive pulmonary function impairment especially if the costophrenic angle is obliterated hypercapnic respiratory failure has been described pleural biopsy may be required to distinguish it from mesothelioma treatment is difficult decortication often fails to result in clinical or functional improvement patient may be eligible for compensation see e pp rounded atelectasis also known as folded lung blesovsky syndrome or shrinking pleuritis with atelectasis develops as contracting visceral pleural fibrosis ensnares and then twists the underlying lung resulting in the distinctive radiological appearance of a rounded or oval pleuralbased mass of cm in diameter asbestos exposure is the most common cause although any cause of pleural inflammation may result in rounded atelectasis ct is often diagnostic demonstrating a comet tail of vessels and bronchi converging toward the lesion adjacent thickened pleura and volume loss in the affected lobe an atypical appearance may require biopsy to exclude malignant disease typically asymptomatic although breathlessness or dry cough may occur usually stable or slowly progressive and no specific treatment is required surgical decortication may

correlation with physiological disease severity asbestosis diagnosis gold standard is pathological demonstration of fibrosis with mineralogical quantification of asbestos bodies the college of american pathologists and pulmonary pathology society have defined a point scheme for grading asbestosis grade fibrosis confined to bronchiolar walls grade fibrosis extends only to firsttier alveoli grade fibrosis involves alveolar ducts and secondtier alveoli grade fibrosis of all alveoli between respiratory bronchioles grade honeycombing in practice histology is rarely required and a diagnosis can be made on the basis of a history of significant asbestos exposure with appropriate delay between exposure and disease and radiographic evidence of fibrosis par ticularly when seen with pleural

hay fever chapter chapter asthma definition epidemiology pathophysiology aetiology definition there is no universally agreed definition asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airway characterized by bronchial hyperreac tivity to a variety of stimuli leading to a variable degree of airway obstruc tion some of which may become irreversible over many years it is a clinical diagnosis based on a history of recurrent episodes of wheeze chest tightness breathlessness andor cough particularly at night evidence of generalized and variable airflow obstruction which may be detected as intermittent wheeze on examination or via tests such as peak expiratory flow pef measurement epidemiology it is the commonest chronic respiratory disease in the uk with a prevalence of there is a wide variation in disease prev alence with highest levels seen in englishspeaking countries where there is also a high prevalence of sensitization to common aeroallergens the reason for the increasing worldwide prevalence over the last few decades is unclear pathophysiology best described as chronic eosinophilic bronchi tisbronchiolitis airway inflammation is seen with cellular infiltration by t helper th cells lymphocytes eosinophils and mast cells there is large and small airway involvement and cytokine production eg plateletactivating factor paf il and leukotrienes airway obstruction occurs due to a combination of inflammatory cell infiltration mucus hypersecretion with mucus plug formation smooth muscle contraction this may become irreversible over time due to basement membrane thickening collagen deposition and epithelial desquamation airway remodelling occurs in chronic disease with smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia this is now recognized as increasingly important in the pathophysiology of the most difficult to treat chronic asthma aetiology this is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors with many different genes identified immunological mechanisms a subgroup of asthmatics are atopic and there fore react to antigen challenge by producing specific ige from blymphocytes this leads to the formation of igeantigen complexes that bind to mast cells basophils and macrophages leading to the release of preformed media tors eg histamine il and other eosinophil chemotactic factors these factors cause bronchoconstriction and airway oedema prostaglandins leukotrienes kinins and paf are all important mes sengers involved in the inflammatory response definition epidemiology pathophysiology aetiology a subgroup of asthmatics up to are now recognized to have noneosinophilic disease which may be associated with a poorer shortterm response to inhaled corticosteroids and is associated with neutrophilic air way inflammation and innate immunity this subgroup may turn out to need a different treatment strategy genetic factors a hereditary component to asthma and atopy is well estab lished and a number of chromosomes and linkages are implicated the multiple mechanisms and messengers involved in asthma make the con tribution of the effects of specific genes difficult to determine established susceptibility loci include the genes adam gpra g proteinrelated receptor for asthma and ormdl a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum proteins the latter was very recently identified by a genomewide screen and its function and role in the pathogenesis of asthma are not yet clear hygiene hypothesis this suggests that asthma may be a byproduct of modern first world cleanliness early life exposure to bacterial endotoxin switches off the allergic response by reducing thmediated pathways and when this exposure is lost the likelihood of developing allergic dis eases such as asthma increases considerably large epidemiological studies support this hypothesis environmental factors the increasing prevalence of asthma appears to be associated with a rising standard of living worldwide and not just in west ernized societies this has implicated a number of environmental factors a number of explanations are speculated but not proven including dietary changes a reduction in childhood infections increased immunization or a combination of all three phenotypic differences it is increasingly recognized that asthma is likely to represent a number of different diseases or subphenotypes rather than one disease with a unifying pathological mechanism subphenotypes may differ in underlying pathophysiology clinical features and disease course and research aimed at clearly identifying such disease subgroups eg through the use of biomarkers such as blood eosinophilia or the host genetic profile is ongoing further information mcgrath kw et al a large subgroup of mildtomoderate asthma

with refractory asthma are a small subgroup of asthma patients they have disease that is difficult to treat evidenced by high maintenance medication requirements or persistent symptoms and airflow obstruction with multiple exacerbations despite high medication use they have high numbers of admissions and cause significant anxiety to their fami lies and medical staff there is a wide range of disease severity including those with highly labile disease and those with severe more chronic airflow obstruction no consensus definition the disease is usually defined on the basis of medication requirements continuous or near continuous oral steroids asthma symptoms frequency of exacerbations severity of airflow limitation patients exhibit the features of asthma and it is thought that the airflow obstruction airway hyperresponsiveness and pef diurnal variability are more severe in refractory disease though the physiological reasons for this remain unclear these patients typically fail to completely reverse their airflow obstruc tion following a week course of oral prednisolone and demonstrate a poor bronchodilator response to inhaled β agonists the pathological mechanism is likely to be ongoing airway inflam mation with increasing airway fibrosis but this is not proven other possibilities include steroid resistance see e p β receptor down regulation or a different disease

mechanisms immunological disease appears after a latency period of exposure thus it is necessary for the worker to be sensitized to the causal agent nonimmunological disease is characterized by the absence of a latent period and occurs after accidental exposure to high concentrations of a workplace irritant this is irritantinduced asthma previously named reactive airways dysfunction syndrome usually caused by exposure to eg smoke vapours or fumes with a strong temporal relationship between irritant exposure and the development of asthmatype symptoms the latency between first exposure and symptom onset can be long and depends on the sensitizing agentan accurate history therefore includes current and past exposures once sensitized reexposure to very low concentrations can provoke

work at home and on holiday bronchial provocationchallenge testing using suspected agentonly in specialized centres but difficulties with testing and producing a valid test substance mean that a negative specific bronchial challenge in a worker with otherwise good evidence of occupational asthma is not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis this is asthma due to specific workplace sensitizers and may account for of adultonset asthma the diagnosis is often difficult to make early diagnosis is important as earlier removal from the workplace in affected individuals leads to a better outcome

dysfunction vocal cord dysfunction a proportion of patients labelled as having severe asthma will have symp toms originating from the upper airway this can be due to vcd and or socalled upper airway hyperresponsiveness these are different but overlap vcd is likely to arise from interrelationships between laryngeal hyperresponsiveness and autonomic imbalance with inputs from poten tial aetiologicalaggravating factors such as reflux psychological stress hypocapnia hyperventilation increased laryngeal hyperresponsiveness can occur following respiratory tract infections and possibly asthma itself upper airway hyperresponsiveness may include more than just the larynx but this is not clear patients will typically present with asthma symptoms with associated trig gers eg odours cold

asthma aetiology the lining of the nose is in continuum with the lower respira tory tract and inflammation of the upper and lower airways often coexists common aeroallergens provoking seasonal allergic rhinitis are tree pollen in the spring and grass pollen in the summer months perennial rhinitis usually reflects allergy to indoor allergens such as house dust mite the provoking allergen is a digestive enzyme that is shed in the faeces cat salivary protein cockroaches or animal dander pathophysiology symptoms occur following the inhalation of allergen to which the subject is sensitized and against which they have ige antibod ies these antibodies bind to mast cell ige receptors with the release of mediators including tryptase and histamine causing symptoms immediately after exposure

the airways disordered anatomy leads to bacterial colonization perpetuating inflammatory change and damaging the mucociliary escalator this prevents bacterial clearance and leads to further airway

inflammatory response ensues with free radical formation and production of neutrophil elastase further con tributing to inflammation bronchial neovascularization with hypertrophy and tortuosity of the bronchial arteries which are at systemic pressure may lead to intermittent haemoptyses aetiology the causes of bronchiectasis are many and varied see table in general the aetiology is either a oneoff infectious insult or an underlying immune deficiency determining the aetiology of the condi tion may lead to different management if for example the underlying cause is found to be cf rather than an

bronchioles are small airways of mm diameter lined by bronchial epithelium and with no cartilage in their walls terminal bronchioles lead to alveoli many bronchioles need to be affected by disease before a patient becomes symptomatic when there will be increased airway resistance unresponsive to β stimulants bronchiolitis is poorly understood and is a mixture of conditions disease seems to affect bronchioles in two main ways affecting the bronchioles in isolation with nonspecific injury causing subsequent epithelial damage and inflammation eg viral bronchiolitis as a bronchiolitis associated with other airway disease where the bronchiolitis may be more of an incidental finding along with other pathologies eg cop hp rbild lch pathophysiology is unclear there is probably an initial injury to the epithelium of the bronchioles with subsequent inflammation adjacent alveoli are often also involved there are two main pathological patterns of bronchiolitis both can exist in the same patient proliferative bronchiolitis more common of the two patterns nonspecific reaction to bronchiolar injury with organizing exudate within the bronchiolar lumen proliferation of intraluminal fibrotic buds called masson bodies seen in bronchioles alveoli and alveolar ducts associated alveolar wall inflammation and foamy macrophages in alveolar spaces may completely or partially resolve tends to be more responsive to steroids the pathology merges with that of cop see e pp constrictive bronchiolitis less common concentric narrowing of the bronchiolar wall due to cellular infiltrates smooth muscle hyperplasia which may cause extrinsic compression obliteration distortion mucus collection peribronchiolar fibrosis and scarring patchy in distribution typically progressive and unresponsive to steroid therapy usually leads to respiratory failure and death in practice these are the commonest situations in which a diagnosis of bronchiolitis is useful viral

of as rare outside japan described y ago in japan as a condition involving both the upper and lower respiratory tracts with bronchiolar inflammation and chronic sinusitis an infectious aetiology was postulated as the cause of this disease but no particular organism has been consistently found it can be familial and is associated with hlab specific to east asians and a korea rarely seen in people of asian descent living abroad more prevalent in men mean age at presentation occurs particularly in nonsmokers chronic sinusitis can precede the chest symptoms often by years most patients have a productive cough with copious purulent sputum exertional dyspnoea wheeze and weight loss there may be pro gressive respiratory failure with signs of cor pulmonale and crackles and management wheezes on auscultation more recently a very similar clinical condition has been increasingly described outside japan in which sinusitis is less commonly found this diffuse version is also an idiopathic inflammatory and suppura tive disorder of the respiratory bronchioles causing progressive and severe airways obstruction it is presumably very similar to the japanese variety and probably underrecognized pfts are obstructive although may show a mixed pattern with minimal airway hyperresponsiveness tlco is reduced cxr and ct may show diffuse illdefined nodules sometimes treeinbud

chronic inflammation and fibrosis of small airways characterized by cd lymphocyte macrophage and neutrophil infiltration with release of proinflammatory cytokines recurrent infections may perpetuate airway inflammation emphysema due to alveolar wall destruction causing irreversible enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole the acinus with subsequent loss of elastic recoil and hyperinflated lungs panacinar emphysema can occur with dilated airspaces evenly distributed across acini centriacinar or proximal emphysema can occur with dilated air spaces found in association with the respiratory bronchioles periacinar or paraseptal emphysema can occur with dilated air spaces at the edge of the acinar unit and abutting a fixed structure such as the pleura or a vessel thickened pulmonary arteriolar wall and remodelling occur with hypoxia leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance pht and impaired gas exchange definition aetiology pathology and clinical features the cause of the increase in airways resistance and hence expiratory flow limitation is multifactorial small airway inflammation reduces the airway lumen emphysema destroys the radial attachments to the small airways which normally hold them open and resist dynamic compression copd is increasingly being recognized as having features not only of pul monary but also systemic inflammation and this may

is associated with the early development of emphysema it is common estimated in individuals and is probably underdiagnosed as it is often asymptomatic in nonsmokers pathophysiology αat is a glycoprotein protease inhibitor produced by the liver it is secreted via the bloodstream into the lungs and opposes neutrophil elastase which destroys alveolar wall connective tissue elastase is produced in increased levels by pulmonary neutrophils and macrophages in response to smoking and lung infections if αat is deficient the elastase cannot be opposed and subsequently basal emphysema develops the dis ease is worse in smokers and can cause copd at a young age s and s there may also be associated liver dysfunction chronic hepatitis cir rhosis and hepatoma as abnormal protein secretion accumulates in the liver predisposition also to skin disease panniculitis and vasculitis espe cially anca ve genetics αat deficiency is inherited as an autosomal codominant disorder so far different alleles have been identified for this gene serpina on the long arm of chromosome chr the commonest alleles are the m allele normal the partially defective s allele and the almost fully

pulmonale definition causes and pathophysiology cor pulmonale is the traditional term for changes in the cardiovascular sys tem resulting from the chronic hypoxia and usually hypercapnia of chronic lung disease mainly pht and fluid retention it does not include similar changes seen in some leftsided disorders such as mitral incompetence cor pulmonale can occur in most situations where there is chronic hypoxia see box most often in the setting of hypoxic and hypercapnic copd hypoventilation syndromes scoliosis neuromuscular diseases obesity much less common when there is no associated rise in paco eg with ilds altitude righttoleft shunts cor pulmonale is often also referred to as right heart failure which is misleading as the cardiac output in cor pulmonale is usually normal or high with increased peripheral perfusion hence the bounding pulse and warm peripheries of type ii ventilatory failure if allowed time to adapt the right ventricle rv can generate much higher pressures eg in idiopathic pulmo nary arterial hypertension ipah than are usually seen in cor pulmonale in response to the hypoxia in true right heart failure the rv acutely fails to develop an adequate cardiac output eg following rightsided mi or pes that occlude a large proportion of the pulmonary vascular bed this also produces a raised jvp as occurs in the fluid overload of cor pulmonale but in contrast there will of course be a low cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion box cor pulmonale results from the following sequence of events lung disease causes hypoxia cyanosis and sometimes polycythaemia hypoxia is sensed both within the kidney and via the carotid body generating increases in sympathetic activity and renal vasoconstriction increased sympathetic activity and other mechanisms leads to renal retention of salt and water this extra salt and water is mainly held in the capacitance vessels the large veins often with a raised jvp if vascular permeability rises particularly when the paco rises producing peripheral vasodilatation and an increase in capillary pressure extra fluid accumulates in dependent tissues mainly the ankles a raised jvp and ankle oedema in this setting are not due to impaired rv function but to fluid overload and increased vascular permeability definition causes and pathophysiology patients often present with their first episode of ankle swelling during an exacerbation of their copd when for the first time the paco rises and the pao falls far enough to provoke the above events body weight may not actually rise very much with the onset of ankle oedema however the extra salt and water retained in the capacitance vessels leading up to the exacerbation move into the subcutaneous tissues probably due to the coinduced vasodilatation raising mean capillary hydrostatic pressure loss of pulmonary vascular bed from emphysema also contributes to the raised pap and the ecg often shows rv hypertrophy during an exac erbation extra hypoxia will produce further rises in pap with which the hypertrophied rv usually copes helped by the raised jvp providing a larger preload to increase rv filling excessive diuresis can lead to a true fall in rightsided output due to inadequate filling of the rv chapter cor pulmonale clinical features and investigations the underlying disease causing the hypoxia eg copdbronchiectasis

always elevate legs when sitting some will venesect if haematocrit exceeds but no rct evidence of physiological benefit or a reduction in hyperviscosity complications in general cor pulmonale is overtreated it is often a relatively harmless byproduct of hypoxia rather than a problem in its own right treating the blood gas disturbance and making it easier for the patient to get his shoes on

complications account for much of the morbidity and mortality in cf the airways of a cf patient are chronically colonized by pathogenic bacteria from an early age bronchiectasis is usually established by a young age around y patients commonly expectorate variable volumes of purulent sputum even when well when organism levels are high patients may feel generally unwell or more tired or have anorexia

antibiotic treatment fev levels should rise to the preinfection normal if they do not further antibiotics may be necessary and other diagnoses or unusual organisms should be considered in practice the fev is the most reliable marker of disease progression and can be used to assess overall decline as well as to determine an exacerbation and response to treatment as pefr would be used in asthma organisms airway colonization changes over time with increasing age and organisms become more resistant to antibiotics typical progression of organism colonization with time is staphylococcus aureus

eradicate organisms with oral antibiotics choice of antibiotics is based on clinical response more than in vitro resistance patterns but recent sputum culture results will also guide therapy in practice it is usually appropriate to give the patient the same regime they had during their last exacerbation provided there was a good clinical response taking into account the patients antibiotic allergies desensitization may be required see e pp recent sputum culture results can be helpful although note that sputum cultures lack sensitivity have a low threshold for including antipseudomonal cover if p aeruginosa has previously been isolated even if assumed to have been eradicated results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing do not always correlate with clinical response to antibiotics all cf centres will have written management protocols which should be followed seek expert advice from your local cf centre if unsure pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with a more rapid decline in lung function most cf patients are chronically infected with p aeruginosa by their early teens nonmucoid species colonize initially which may be asymptomatic or intermittent and can be eradicated and mucoid species then follow and permanent eradication is rare the aims of treatment are prompt eradication of new isolates and maintenance therapy to reduce the bacterial load in colonized patients first isolates of p aeruginosa in patients who were previously pseudomonasfree or who have never had p aeruginosa should lead to prompt treatment with an eradication regimen even if asymptomatic failure to treat may lead to the development of chronic airway infection there is no clear evidence favouring a specific eradication regimen an initial treatment protocol combining

after an initial assessment and with home support from nursing staff many patients are relatively well during courses of iv antibiotics and are able to continue attending work or college although it can take them considerable extra time to administer the antibiotics most antibiotic regimes involve days of iv antibiotics this may require the siting of an iv cannula with a microbiological filter to make it last longer or preferably a long line many patients have an indwelling venous access device see following section that can be accessed when required prior to starting iv antibiotics clinical assessment including spirometry should be made patients should be reviewed at day to ensure satisfactory clinical progress and to consider changing antibiotics if little or no improvement and at end of the course in outpatients to ensure clinical improvement courses of iv antibiotics are often administered prophylactically before surgery and regular elective courses of iv antibiotics may be useful for patients who have experienced a rapid and progressive increase in the decline of their lung function or who suffer frequent exacerbations implantable venous access devices ivads eg portacath inserted in patients with difficult iv access or those needing frequent courses of iv antibiotics usually accessed by a trained nurse patient or family member access only with a huber point

the focus of care should adjust to being palliative with an emphasis on symptom relief at home or in hospital or a hospice the transition from active treatment to palliative care is often difficult in cf as many endoflife events begin as an exacerbation and it may be difficult to predict or define when patients are entering a terminal phase there is often an overlap between active and palliative care eg some active treatments such as gentle physiotherapy and even niv may have a palliative role in symptom control and for this reason most deaths occur in hospital a particular challenge is palliative care of patients on an active transplant waiting list when unrealistic hopes about the availability of a lastminute transplant may delay discussion of end of life and compromise symptom control open and sensitive discussion about endoflife care is encouraged but approaches should be dynamic and tailored to the needs of individual patients effective communication amongst the cf team

eosinophilic lung disease eosinophilic lung disease definition pulmonary eosinophilias are disorders classically associ ated with cxr infiltrates and a raised blood eosinophil count although eosinophilic infiltration of the lung can occur without blood eosinophilia eosinophilia is found on lung biopsy or bal eosinophils are phagocytes that are produced in bone marrow and circulate for up to h before localizing in tissues their blood levels are usually tightly regulated in health they accumulate in the gi tract mucosa but they may be attracted to other tissues by chemoattractant mechanisms including mast cell activation and complement activation eosinophils can survive in the tissues for weeks if appropriate cytokines are present normal eosinophil counts are below l of peripheral wcc counts of l upwards can be seen in pulmonary eosinophilia persisting high eosinophil levels hypereosinophilia cause tissue damage due to their proinflammatory effects whatever the cause eosinophils accumulate in allergic or hypersensitivity disease parasitic infections and cancer steroids and severe sepsis both decrease eosinophil levels asthma can cause a raised eosinophil count especially if there is associated eczema but an absolute eosinophil count of l is very unusual and raises the possibility of an alternative diagnosis such as churgstrauss syndrome now known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis egpa blood eosinophilia can occur in a variety of conditions eosinophilia occurs in haematological malignancies eosinophilia is a response to a stimulus

immunosuppression chapter extreme environments flying altitude diving lung disease and flying altitude sickness diving chapter extreme environments lung disease and flying problems flying presents problems for three reasons extra hypoxia volume changes in gas compartments closed environment and disease transmission extra hypoxia some more recent airplanes may be pressurized to the equivalent of about ft m this gives an atmospheric pressure of about kpa and an fio of about kpa compared with kpa at sea level in normal subjects this causes inconsequential falls in pao and sao however many companies pressurize to the minimum allowed ft eg boeing ft or m the same as some of the lower ski resorts in colorado equivalent to an fio of kpa equivalent to breathing o at sea level and even in normal subjects the sao may fall to or so the new airbus is pressurized to ft m and the new boeing to ft m patients with lung disease and a degree of hypoxia will be nearer the steep part of the hb dissociation curve and will experience bigger pro portional falls in o carriage by the blood the estimated pao at ft m the lowest cabin pressurization likely to be encountered is empirically estimated by the formula estimated pao at ft m pao at sea level fevvc for example if sea level pao kpa fevvc estimated pao kpa this is a rough approximation and will vary considerably from patient to patient particularly due to differences in hypoxic drive an alternative is to give the patient a hypoxic challenge for min minimum and meas ure the paosao this is most easily achieved by feeding a venturi mask with nitrogen which simulates a little under ft m equivalent to o there is no evidence this predicts whether a patient will or will not run into trouble recently edvardsen et al confirmed that the result of a hypoxic challenge test in patients with moderate to severe copd did not predict whether they developed symptoms during a flight although the preflight mrc dyspnoea score did predict symptoms those that had supplemental o had fewer symptoms regardless of the simulated hypoxia testing empirically o is often prescribed if the inflight pao at ft m estimated from the above equation or by experimentation is kpa or sao others have used sao during a mwt to try and improve the ability to predict sao during hypoxia testing none of this is evidencebased so a simple recommendation based on sea level oximetry measurements is likely to be as valid in conjunction with further informa tion such as how disabled the patient is already by shortness of breath their previous flight experience length of proposed flight time since last exacerbation and importance of the trip to the patient etc lung disease and flying the suggestions in box are similar to bts guidelines which are a little more complex and consider comorbidities lmin via nasal cannulae or venturi mask is usually sufficient to raise sao to sea level equivalent airlines vary over charging for this allow at least a month to arrange it see british lung foundation blf reference under further information for each airlines procedure a medif form or equivalent will require completion by the gp or specialist occasionally patients are allowed to bring their own o on board as hand luggage some airlines prohibit using o during takeoff and landing volume changes in gas compartments ascent to the equivalent of ft m increases gas trapped in compartments by ascent to ft m by nearly a pneumothorax or noncommunicating bullae therefore increases by this amount patients with current pneumo thoraces should not fly it used to be advised not to fly within weeks of a pneumothorax slightly higher chance of recurrence and lack of adequate emergency treatment on board this has recently been changed to week after full radiographic resolution or weeks in the case of a traumatic pneumothorax patients having had recent thoracic surgery for whatever reason are now advised they can fly once recovered from the surgery itself previously advised to wait weeks none of this is evidencebased and the true risks of ignoring these guidelines are not known it is probable that the risk of a second pneumothorax in the absence of definitive manage ment pleurodesis etc is only high enough to worry about in patients with preexisting lung disease who should be made aware of this higher risk closed environment patients with

by the hypoxia pathophysiology some of the pathophysiology is well understood and explains some of the symptoms and signs these largely fall into two cat egories minor and major minor due to hyperventilationhypocapniaalkalosiscerebral vasocon striction provoked by the hypoxia and include lightheadednessfatigue numbnesstingling of extremities nauseavomiting and anorexia headache insomniasleep disturbance periodic ventilation during sleep these symptoms are common develop over h after arrival and affect at least a quarter of those flying to colorado for a skiing holiday altitude m ft barometric pressure kpa inspired o tension kpa average sao on arrival most of the symptoms are due to a respiratory hypocapnic alkalosis and resolve as the kidney retains h and excretes hco returning ph towards normal this allows further hyperventilation and the rise in sao helps resolve any of the symptoms due to the hypoxia itself this scenario tends to be common in those with a higher hypoxic drive measured at sea level as it encourages greater hypocapnia and alkalosis confusingly these symptoms may also indicate the early development of the more major category major those due to the hypoxia itself these are more serious can develop rapidly and tend to occur more in those with a lower hypoxic drive there is also a genetic component influencing susceptibility related to the ace gene in high altitude pulmonary oedema hape the hypoxia provokes a nonuniform pulmonary vasoconstriction raising pap hence some pul monary capillaries are unprotected and receive the full rise in pap fluid leakage into alveoli pulmonary oedema and capillary damage with pul monary haemorrhage produce clinically apparent disease the dominant symptomssigns are extra breathlessnesscough

cerebral throm bosis and petechial haemorrhages the dominant symptoms are ataxia may be the first sign confusiondisorientationhallucinationsbehavioural change severe headachereduced conscious level papilloedema both hape and hace are potentially fatal altitude sickness management risk factors are mainly the rate and degree of altitude attained keep ascent to m ftday and rest every third day the minor form of altitude sickness is likely to resolve spontaneously over a few days with simple symptomatic treatment analgesics and plenty of hydration however prophylaxis or early treatment on symptom appearance with acetazolamide is very effective as are limiting further ascent and encourag ing descent acetazolamide provokes a mild metabolic acidosis by reducing h availability for excretion in the distal tubule and preacclimatizes the subject to allow greater hyperventilation in response to hypoxia without the usual alkalosis it is recommended when rapid ascent to altitudes m ft is unavoidable such as a package ski trip to aspen mgday slow release for the days prior to ascent is probably adequate for most subjects or as treatment after symptoms develop the commonest side effect is a harmless and reversible tingling of the extremities temazepam has been shown to reduce the periodic breathing at night by reducing the arousals that help maintain the periodicity and does not appear to worsen the hypoxia or reduce vigilance levels the following day the best predictor of severe altitude sickness is a prior episode it may be possible to predict likely severe problems based on sea level estimates of a poor hypoxic response but this has not been fully validated the management of the more severe forms of altitude sickness that tend to occur with rapid ascent to over m ft pulmonary and cerebral oedema is urgent management of severe altitude sickness increase inspired o tension by rapid descent extra inspired o or a local pressurized environment eg a portable hyperbaric chamber such as the gamow bag m httpswwwyoutubecom watchvsjazuzhuue hape sit upright and keep warm nifedipine mg bd up to qds loading dose mg sublingually to reduce pap acetazolamide may help by also reducing pap as well as increasing the effective ventilatory response to altitude hypoxia hace dexamethasone mg qds loading dose mg to reduce cerebral oedema improvement is usually rapid

piratory problems at depth these can essentially be divided into five barotrauma eg ruptured bullae and pneumothorax worsening of preexisting disorder whilst at depth eg asthma nitrogen gas evolved from solution in body fluids the bends breathhold diving and ascent hypoxia pulmonary oedema pathophysiology barotrauma second commonest cause of death in scuba divers after drown ing during descent any aircontaining cavity in the body will be com pressed by the rise in external pressure if there is any communication with the airways eg middle ear lung bullae then gas will slowly move into the airspace on ascent the airspace will expand and if air cannot escape quickly enough may lead to rupture of the eardrum or the bullae a tension pneumothorax can be rapidly fatal in this situation obstructive lung diseases in general can predispose to ruptured alveoli in addition to pneumothora ces the escaped air can produce a pneumomediastinum causing chest pain and a radiolucent band air in the pericardium along the cardiac border on cxr breathing o will clear this air more quickly air emboli can also occur and produce a wide range of symptoms hyperbaric o may be required preexisting lung disease the onset of asthma during a dive can be disas trous and may be provoked by the dry gases breathed from scuba gear selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus see british subaqua club bsac recommendations on asthma and diving see box many lung diseases such as cf copd fev predicted fibrotic lung disease previous pneumothorax with no pleurodesis and lung bullae are con sidered contraindications to diving however recently bsac has adopted the pragmatic approach of accepting that in individuals with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax who have had no pneumothorax for y the risk of pulmonary barotrauma is small and not significantly greater than for many in the general population eg smokers such individuals may dive provided that a ct scan of the chest and lung function tests including flow volume loops show no reason to suggest that there is significant residual lung disease the bends or caisson disease caisson is an underwater air chamber in which people work during periods of high pressure extra nitrogen dissolves into the blood and other tissue fluids this takes many minutes on ascent this nitrogen literally bubbles off if the amount coming out of solution is too great nitrogen bubbles act as emboli and limit blood flow this produces microinfarction with activation of inflammatory and clotting cascades and damage to several organs eg joints spinal cord brain limited diving times and slow ascents reduce this problem as do breathing mixtures containing helium rather than nitrogen severe cases require treatment in hyperbaric chambers diving breathhold diving during breathhold diving increased pressure on the chest elevates alveolar and arterial po this extends breathhold time par ticularly with prior hyperventilation to reduce paco during the dive o is used and po falls on ascent with rarefaction of the thoracic gas po falls quickly with possible loss of consciousness and drowning pulmonary oedema has been reported whilst scuba

frequently difficult if complete removal from antigen is unrealistic eg farmers measures to reduce exposure may be of benefit such as respiratory protection with highperformance positivepressure masks avoidance of particularly heavy exposure improved ventilation and use of air filters drying of hay prior to storage in acute hp symptoms typically resolve following cessation of antigen exposure and treatment is usually not required removal from exposure may also result in symptomatic and physiological improvement in chronic hp although this is less certain and established pulmonary fibrosis is often irreversible when treatment is required corticosteroids are frequently used although there is a lack of randomized controlled evidence to support this steroids may hasten the resolution of impaired pulmonary function in acute hp although their effect on longterm outcome is unclear they appear to be of benefit in some cases of chronic hp a typical regimen is prednisolone mgkg until symptoms and radiological changes have resolved and then slowly reduce dose over several months to a maintenance dose of approxi mately mg daily courses of months may be sufficient in subacute hp although more prolonged courses are usually required for progressive or chronic disease prognosis is highly variable prognosis is usually excellent following removal from antigen exposure in acute hp although progression to res piratory failure and death may very rarely occur after shortterm exposures of very high intensity recurrent episodes of acute hp do not necessarily progress to chronic hp and fibrosis and chronic hp may develop in the absence of previous acute hp episodes development of chronic hp with ongoing exposure may eventually lead to cor pulmonale and death although again this is variable and many patients do not exhibit disease progression despite chronic exposure persistent lowdose exposure eg budgerigar in the house may be more likely to progress to the chronic fibrotic

exercise may be associated with symptoms of respiratory alkalosis such as numbness tingling of the extremities feelings of impending doom and lightheadedness occasionally to the point of losing consciousness cerebral vasoconstriction due to the hypocapnia sensation of not being able to take a satisfactory breath no history suggestive of an alternative current respiratory disorder although there may have been one previously history of some stressful situation in the patients life previous episodes diagnosis diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion but with additional confirmatory findings no evidence of a respiratory cause ie normal lung function normal cxr and normal sao at rest and on exercise to the point of breathlessness sao may even rise on exercise no evidence of a

failure lactacidosis ketoacidosis chapter hyperventilation syndrome management it is important not to dismiss the patients symptoms implying it is all in the mind the patient has a real symptom which requires a real explana tion there are no controlled trials of management but most clinicians will offer an explanation based on an overawareness of respiratory sensa tions occasioned by some previous respiratory illness heightened by anxi ety it is important to explain that the associated symptoms of tingling and lightheadedness are well recognized and harmless old recommendations to rebreathe into a paper bag have not stood the test of time and are rather impractical in the middle of a supermarket because cold peripheries often accompany an episode vasoconstriction placing the cold palms on to the cheeks can help suppress the desire to breathe thought to be related to the diving reflex again this is an untested remedy careful and convincing explanation without over investigation may be enough stressing the normality of the investigations a short period on an anxiolytic eg diazepam mg bd may be helpful to demonstrate that the symptoms can be controlled management of the psychological problem may be possible some experienced respiratory physiotherapists can help patients control their symptoms and divert the anxiety away from breathing failure to respond should always prompt a reconsideration of whether an underlying disorder is gradually progressing to the point where an inves tigation becomes abnormal on the other hand repeated investigations will confirm the patients concern that the doctors think there is something wrong prognosis some patients improve quickly with explanation some tend to relapse at times of stress some prove resistant to any treatment

lip chapter chapter idiopathic interstitial pneumonias overview definition the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias iips comprise a group of diffuse lung diseases of unknown aetiology that primarily involve the pul monary interstitiumthe area between the alveolar epithelium and cap illary endothelium as well as the septal and bronchovascular tissues that make up the fibrous framework of the lung these primarily interstitial processes however frequently also involve the airways vasculature and alveolar airspaces the underlying pathological process is one of varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis the terminology used to describe the iips may be confusing these con ditions have been subject to much reclassification reflecting the lack of understanding of their underlying aetiology and pathogenesis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf previously termed cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis is the commonest iip and is characterized by the radiological and histologi cal pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia uip the other iips are distinct disease entities and are all rare they all represent a subgroup of interstitial or diffuse parenchymal lung diseases diagnosis made from a multidisciplinary approach taking into account the combination of clinical hrct and histological featuresdistinguish from other causes of diffuse lung disease see e p histological pat terns are often considered to be the most specific but must be interpreted in the context of clinical and radiological features surgical lung biopsy is rec ommended for many cases of suspected iip with the exception of patients exhibiting typical clinical and hrct features of ipf tbbs have a very limited role due to the generally patchy distribution of the iips although they may be useful in the diagnosis of acute interstitial pneumonitis aip and organ izing pneumonia op as well as the exclusion of other causes of diffuse lung disease eg sarcoidosis the conditions currently included within the classification of iips together with their key clinical imaging and histological features and prognosis are presented in table see e p in order of frequency and dis cussed in detail in the remainder

chronic interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause character ized histologically by temporal and spatial heterogeneity with areas of fibro sis and architectural distortion interspersed with areas of normal lung this occurs as different areas of lung are in varying stages of evolution of the pathological process the term uip refers to the radiological hrct and histological appearance of ipf previously known as cfa note that the uip pattern is nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions eg connec tive tissue disease asbestosis epidemiology prevalence figures vary from to although prevalence may be in patients years old slightly more common in median age at presentation familial form well described but very rare causes and pathophysiology the development of fibrosis was pre viously thought to reflect a response to chronic inflammation although this has been questioned in light of the observations that inflammation is not a major feature of pathological specimens and that responses to antiinflammatory treatment with steroids are poor an alternative cur rently favoured theory is that repeated alveolar epithelial injury leads directly to aberrant wound healing with activation of mesenchymal cells and the formation of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic foci that secrete excessive extracellular matrix primarily collagens the nature of the lung injury remains obscure postulated triggers include inhalation of metal dust and wood dust smoking gastrooesophageal reflux or exposure to herpesviruses cytokine production eg plasminogen activator inhibitors matrix metalloproteinases transforming growth factorβ by alveolar epi thelial cells may play an important role in the development of fibrosis host genetic factors are also likely to be important in the pathogenesis of fibrosis eg mucb and elmod gene polymorphisms and telomerase mutations clinical features typically presents with gradualonset exertional breathlessness and cough average of months of symptoms prior to presentation of patients are said to be asymptomatic although this is likely to be an underestimate fine basal late inspiratory crackles clubbing in up to cyanosis and cor pulmonale

characterized by temporal and spatial heterogeneity patches of active fibroblastic foci reflecting acute injury are interspersed with honeycombingarchitectural distortion reflecting chronic scarring and areas of normal lung reflecting varying stages of evo lution of the disease process in different areas of lung interstitial inflam mation is minimal significant interobserver disagreement between expert pathologists regarding the presence of a uip pattern on lung biopsy has been reported and an overall diagnosis taking into account clinical radio logical and histological features is recommended diagnosis can be confidently made in most cases on the basis of clinical and hrct findings lung biopsy is not generally recommended in patients with typical clinical and hrct features of ipf but should be considered in the presence of unusual features eg predominant ground glassnodules consolidationupper lobe involvement on hrct or young patient when required biopsies should be obtained at vats or thoracotomy tbbs are not recommended as they provide smaller samples which are rarely diagnostic differential diagnosis lvf a common clinical misdiagnosis in ipf and patients are often prescribed inappropriate diuretics fibrotic nsip and other iips asbestosis may mimic clinically and radiologically with uip pattern on histology occupational history and presence of pleural

a uip pattern chronic sarcoidosis druginduced lung disease refer to m httpwwwpneumotoxcom chapter idiopathic interstitial pneumonias ipf management clinical trials of therapy in ipf are particularly challenging older stud ies were hindered by inclusion of a heterogeneous patient group but even within groups of patients with welldefined ipf there remains significant heterogeneity in clinical course furthermore some relatively recent large studies of ipf have been poorly designed eg failing to include a placebo group there is ongoing debate as to optimal trial design and end points including the definition of minimally important clinical difference in fvc drug treatments that are not recommended based on previous stud ies include corticosteroid monotherapy combination triple therapy with prednisolone azathioprine and acetylcysteine azathioprine cyclophos phamide colchicine ciclosporin imatinib interferon gammab inspire study bosentan build study ambrisentan etanercept and warfarin specific points of note from these studies include prior to the reclassification of iips studies suggested that corticosteroids might improve lung function and symptoms however these studies almost certainly included patients with conditions other than ipf that are associated with a better treatment response and prognosis eg nsip combination of oral prednisolone azathioprine and acetylcysteine was initially reported to confer a small improvement in lung function when compared with prednisolone and azathioprine alone ifigenia trial and despite the lack of a placebo arm this study led to widespread use of such triple therapy interim analysis of the pantheripf study in demonstrated that this combination was however associated with higher mortality and hospitalization rates than placebo and consequently the use of azathioprine or triple therapy should be avoided although a small openlabel placebocontrolled study suggested a possible survival benefit from anticoagulation a subsequent study aceipf trial reported an increased mortality and serious adverse event rate with warfarin anticoagulation is not recommended management treatment options should be considered in the context of the individual patients clinical condition comorbidity and wishes particu larly in view of the often unpredictable disease course unknown efficacy of treatment and high frequency of serious side effects principles of treat ment are as follows supportive treatment consider use of home o concentrator if limited by breathlessness and persistent resting pao kpa or kpa in the setting of clinical features of pht use of ambulatory o may improve exercise tolerance encourage pulmonary rehabilitation programme gastrooesophageal reflux disease is common in ipf and may drive lung fibrosis symptomatic patients should be treated with ppis promotility agents eg domperidone treatment of asymptomatic gord is recommended in the ats guidelines although there is currently little direct evidence to support this cough may be troublesome consider oral codeine opioids are frequently required for palliation of severe breathlessness ipf management drugs should be considered in a closely observed trial of therapy patients should be offered inclusion in clinical trials where possible monotherapy with oral acetylcysteine an antioxidant and antifibrotic at a dose of mg tds is of unproven efficacy the final analysis of the pantheripf trial should resolve this question but unlikely to cause significant harm and it is widely used treatment with pirfenidone antifibrotic inhibits collagen synthesis and reduces fibroblast proliferation has been associated with a small beneficial effect on rate of fvc decline capacity trials and but is often limited by side effects it has recently been approved by nice for use in the uk for patients with fvc between and predicted although should be discontinued if there is evidence of ongoing disease progression decrease in fvc by or more within months studies do not support treatment with steroids in ipf and nice guidance recommends that steroids should not be used in an attempt to modify disease progression except in acute exacerbations where benefit is possible but unproven see box despite this oral prednisolone is still sometimes used in practice particularly when specifically requested by an informed patient for attempted symptom control eg cough or when there is diagnostic uncertainty may be of benefit in patients with other iips misdiagnosed as ipf significant side effects of steroid treatment eg hyperglycaemia necessitating insulin osteoporosis myopathy peptic ulcer disease cataracts raised intraocular pressure psychosis are very common in this patient group monitoring disease progression and response to treatment are best assessed by serial measurements of fvc and tlco document them at each clinic attendance absolute changes in fvc or tlco of or more are considered significant in terms of assessing disease progression note that a realistic aim of diseasemodifying treatment in ipf is to slow progression rather than improve lung function changes in symptoms such as exercise tolerance and cough frequencyseverity may also be useful lung transplantation patients with ipf are often referred for consideration of transplantation too late and many die whilst on the waiting list which is around months in the uk guidelines recommend referral of all suitable patients with histological or radiographic evidence of uip irrespective of vc and without delaying for trials of treatment these are not widely applied in the uk and in practice referral is often considered in symptomatic patients aged y with tlco predicted fall in fvc or in tlco over months o desaturation on min walk andor

subgroup declines more quickly accelerated variant mainly male smokers and between and experience a very rapid decline after a period of relative stability acute exacerbation of ipf see box prognosis is difficult to predict in individual patients mean sur vival from diagnosis is y poor prognostic factors include tlco at presentation o desaturation during min walk and fall of in fvc or in tlco in the first months the presence of pht is associated with a particularly poor prognosis more extensive fibroblas tic foci on lung biopsy have also been shown to correlate with shorter survival death is commonly due to respiratory failure andor infection increased risk of developing lung cancer particularly in peripheral fibrotic areas of lung future developments there is significant current interest in clinical trial design for ipf and specifically the development of robust outcome measures only relatively few trials to date have included patients with advanced disease the development of biomarkers to identify subgroups of patients with differing responses to treatment or outcomes is another area of interest therapeutic agents currently under evaluation include a controlled trial of sildenafil a pde inhibitor in advanced ipf stepipf trial reported no effect on the outcome of significant increase in min walk distance although small but significant improvements in outcomes oxygenation gas transfer degree of dyspnoea and qol were noted in the sildenafil group trials are ongoing silent gord appears to be common in ipf and episodes of microaspiration may drive lung fibrosis clinical trials of treatment of asymptomatic gord are in progress treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor bibf which targets growth factor receptors involved in lung fibrosis in a phase trial was associated with a reduced frequency of acute exacerbations and a trend towards a reduction in the decline of fvc a phase clinical trial is in progress a small singlecentre study of thalidomide reported an improvement in cough and respiratory qol in patients with ipf a larger trial is awaited a trial of cotrimoxazole reported no effect on lung function but a possible mortality benefit which may be partly explained by attenuation of increased mortality related to immunosuppression side effects were common particularly nausea and rash trials of the cclspecific monoclonal antibody cnto are underway stem cell therapy aimed at repairing lungs injured by fibrosis is an area of future research ipf prognosis and future developments box acute exacerbations of ipf acute exacerbations of ipf are otherwise unexplained acute worsening of dyspnoea or new development of dyspnoea in patients with known ipf they are usually defined as onset days although some patients experience apparent exacerbations over the course of weeks hrct typically shows extensive ground glass andor consolidation super imposed on a background uip pattern of reticulation or honeycomb ing consider other exacerbants in particular infection including pcp pneumothorax left heart failure pe and other causes of lung injury eg druginduced ctpa with hrct slices is usually the radiological inves tigation of choice as pes may coexist with ild bal is helpful in excluding atypical infection particularly pcp but patients are often too hypoxic to safely undergo this procedure treatment is usually attempted with highdose steroids eg iv methylprednisolone mgg on consecutive days followed by maintenance therapy with mgkgday of predni solone in practice infection is difficult to confidently exclude and treat ment with broadspectrum antibiotics alongside steroids is usual acute exacerbations are increasingly recognized as an important cause of death in mild to moderate apparently stable ipf and also appear to occur in the setting of other forms of fibrotic lung disease such as con nective tissue diseaseassociated pneumonitis chronic hp and fibrotic nsip the mechanism is poorly understood although viral infection may act as a trigger and some exacerbations occur postoperatively includ ing after surgical lung biopsy the histological pattern is of diffuse alveolar damage associated with uip although a minority of cases have features of op inpatient mortality is rising to within months of discharge the outcome of invasive ventilation in patients with known ipf is very poor mortality approaching and icu admission is not usu ally appropriate in the setting of underlying ipfextensive fibrotic change chapter idiopathic interstitial pneumonias nonspecific interstitial pneumonia nsip definition the term nsip is a description of a histological pattern rather than a specific clinical entity this form of iip is particularly poorly understood

nsip with an ipflike profileoverlap nsipipf nsip with an organizing pneu monia profile nsipop and nsip with a hypersensitivity profile nsip hp the clinical utility of this subclassification is uncertain patients with nsip on lung biopsy have a generally better prognosis and greater response to steroids when compared with patients with ipf nsip may be idiopathic or occur in association with other systemic conditions most notably con nective tissue diseases epidemiology typically affects younger patients than ipf with age of onset y may rarely affect children causesassociations idiopathic

commonest underlying disorder mediastinal widening is common ct chest with contrast can stage the underlying malignancy and image the venous circulation and collateral blood supply histological diagnosis usual practice is to obtain a tissue diagnosis of the underlying disease before starting treatment as the underlying diagnosis can alter treatment markedly symptomatic obstruction will have been developing for some weeks prior to presentation and in the clinically stable patient a delay of h whilst the correct underlying diagnosis is obtained is warranted radiotherapy prior to biopsy can

initial general treatment o analgesia sitting the patient up to reduce venous pressure and steroids in some followed by treatment of the underlying disease causing the svco dependent on the tissue

not a contraindication to the procedure as clot can be dispersed mechanically or with thrombolysis at the time of the procedure stent complications stent migration is the major complication but most patients do not live long enough for this to be a major problem anticoagulation some recommend prophylactic anticoagulation in the presence of svco small increased risk of intracerebral bleeding but the benefits of svco treatment may be limited by subsequent svc thrombus if anticoagulation is not started this is controversial svco due to thrombosis is usually in association with central venous lines or pacemaker wires if the clot is days old as judged by symptoms thrombolysis is warranted subsequent oral anticoagulation may reduce recurrence prognosis depends on the underlying disease and

irreversible paraplegia and loss of bowel and bladder function definition and aetiology spinal cord compression occurs commonly in patients with metastatic cancer in about of all cancer patients partic ularly breast lung and prostate cancer it may be the first presentation of cancer but often occurs in patients with a known tumour cord compres sion is commonly caused by direct spread from a vertebral metastasis into the extradural space most commonly thoracic spine or less commonly from pressure on the cord from a tumour in the posterior mediastinum or the retroperitoneum or by pressure from a mass of retroperitoneal nodes it is unusual to have a metastasis within the cord itself although meningeal spread can occur spinal cord compression causes interruption of the arterial supply to the cord and subsequent infarction clinical features patients frequently experience back pain initially due to associated vertebral collapse this precedes any neurological signs pain is not however universal neurological signs may be nonspecific weak legs constipation urinary incontinence leg weakness develops over hours to days with associated sensory loss loss of bladder and bowel sensation is a late sign and usually heralds irreversible paraplegia within hours or a few days examination reveals bilateral upper motor neurone signs in the legs with increased tone weakness brisk reflexes and extensor plantars there may be sensory loss in the legs particularly with a loss of propriocep tion and a sensory level on the trunk sensory loss in the saddle area with decreased rectal tone suggests a cauda equina lesion the bladder may be palpable investigations have a low threshold for investigating a patient with known cancer with back pain mri of the spine is the investigation of choice to demonstrate the level of the cord compression ct is less reliable but can also be helpful if mri is not available plain spine xray may show vertebral metastases but this is usually unhelpful as there is no imaging of the spinal cord time should not be wasted in obtaining a plain xray bone scan shows vertebral metastases but again does not image the spinal cord earlier scans showing bony metastases may alert the physician to the possibility of future cord compression if patient is not known to have underlying malignant disease a search for a tumour should be performed but must not delay

endobronchial carcinoid tumours they typically appear to be intraluminal cherry red and covered with intact epithelium bronchial brushings may be adequate for a histological diagnosis bronchial biopsy had been previously thought to be associated with the risk of significant bleeding although case series suggest the risk is likely to be low however some avoid biopsy altogether and proceed to surgical resection based on a clinical diagnosis ctguided biopsy may be preferred for peripheral tumours histological diagnosis can be difficult as the appearances can be similar to those of sclc special stains and immunohistochemistry are used to help differentiate between the two clinically however these tend to be quite different conditions and clinical details can aid pathological diagnosis carcinoid tumours are characterized as being typical or atypical they each have a characteristic pattern typical carcinoids have no necrosis occasional nuclear pleomorphism and absent or late mitoses distant metastases are rare and metastasis to lymph nodes occurs in of cases the y survival is and y survival is pulmonary carcinoid tumours atypical carcinoids may show focal necrosis and often have nuclear pleomorphism there is increased mitotic activity and increased levels of mib expression an immunohistochemical marker of cell proliferation they have distant metastases in and metastasize to the lymph nodes in of cases the y survival is and y survival is management patients with isolated pulmonary carcinoid tumours should be considered for surgical resection resection is ideally limited removing minimal amounts of normal lung parenchyma tumour resection is associated with resolution of any features of the carcinoid syndrome if the tumour is atypical or close to the resection margin patients should be followed up with repeat cxr on an annual basis radiotherapy is not performed endobronchial resection may be rarely possible in highly selected patients with an intraluminal polypoid tumour with no ct evidence of an extraluminal component careful bronchoscopic and imaging followup is essential tumour size does not relate to the presence of lymph node metastases and therefore local lymph nodes should be sampled perioperatively in the with carcinoid syndrome serotonin antagonists such as octreotide or lanreotide can be used for treatment isolated liver metastases can be treated with resection arterial embolization or rfa metastatic aggressive carcinoid tumours can be treated with chemotherapy such as etoposide cisplatin and fluorouracil although limited trial efficacy data mean there is no standard regime peptide receptor radioligand therapy eg therapeutic i mibg or luoctreotate is offered in some centres studies are examining the role of other drugs such as mtor inhibitors eg everolimus and tyrosine kinase inhibitors eg sunitinib with a possible benefit associated with addition of everolimus to longacting octreotide therapy

monthly cxr and sputum cytology for y in smokers y old or older of day with infrequent or no screening in a control group cancers were found in the study group and in the control group but allcause mortality was not affected by screening even at y more recent studies have used lowdose spiral ct scanning the early lung cancer action project elcap in new york recruited symptomfree volunteers aged

and at annual ct lung cancer was diagnosed in of people stage i with having resection and having radiotherapy chemotherapy there was no nontreatment randomized control group so it is still difficult to interpret whether the earlier diagnosis and intervention led to longer survival the national lung screening trial nlst evaluated annual ldct vs cxr screening in patients aged y with a pack year smoking history including those who quit within y showing a reduction in lung cancer and reduction in allcause mortality in the ct arm patients would need to be screened to prevent one lung cancer

sometimes a patch of bronchial breathing above the fluid level a friction rub may be heard with pleural inflammation imaging cxr sequential blunting of posterior lateral and then anterior costophrenic angles are seen on radiographs as effusions increase in size pa cxr will usually detect effusion volumes of ml or more lateral cxr is more sensitive and may detect as little as ml pleural fluid classical cxr appearance is of basal opacity obscuring hemidiaphragm with concave upper border massive effusion may result in a whiteout of the hemithorax with mediastinal displacement away from the effusion lack of mediastinal shift in such cases raises the possibility of associated volume loss due to bronchial obstruction from a lung cancer other cxr appearances include rounded or lentiform shadowing in loculated interlobar effusions and diffuse shadowing throughout the hemithorax on supine films cxr appearance may suggest the underlying diagnosis eg bilateral effusions with cardiomegaly in cardiac failure massive effusions are most commonly seen due to malignancy us see e p has a much higher sensitivity than cxr at detecting and localizing pleural fluid and is useful for distinguishing pleural fluid from pleu ral masses or thickening sonographic appearances can be useful at predict ing exudates echogenic or septated fluid and for predicting malignancy its use for pleural procedures increases success at fluid aspiration and reduces risk of complications ct chest with pleural contrast is useful in distinguishing benign and malignant pleural disease nodular mediastinal or circumferential pleural thickening and parietal pleural thickening cm are all highly specific for malignant dis ease scans are best performed prior to complete drainage of fluid ct may

randomised controlled trial lancet chapter pleural effusion malignant pleural effusion management key points influencing the management of malignant effusions are symptoms performance status and wishes of the patient sensitivity of the tumour to chemotherapy eg small cell lung carcinoma lymphoma ovarian and breast carcinoma may respond to chemotherapy although in some cases pleural effusions remain problematic and require additional treatment extent of lung reexpansion following effusion drainage treatment options observation and followup if asymptomatic therapeutic pleural aspiration of l pleural fluid to improve breathless ness see e p can be performed at the bedside as a daycase proce dure avoiding hospital admission useful in the palliation of breathlessness in patients with a poor prognosis and in rare cases where effusion reaccu mulates very slowly most effusions recur within month of aspiration and these patients should be considered for pleurodesis or insertion of an ipc repeated aspiration may be inconvenient and uncomfortable for the patient and carries a risk of complications such as empyema pneumothorax and tumour seeding in mesothelioma if the breathlessness does not improve following fluid aspiration then there is little to be gained by repeated aspiration and other causes of breathlessness should be considered eg lymphangitis carcinomatosis pe intercostal chest drainage and pleurodesis the aim of pleurodesis is to seal the visceral pleura to the parietal pleura with adhesions to prevent pleural fluid accumulating the success of pleurodesis depends on the degree of apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura which depends on the degree of lung reexpansion following drainage of the effusion trapped lung occurs when tumour encases the visceral pleura and prevents lung expan sion lung expansion may also be inhibited by a proximal airway obstruction or by a persistent air leak eg after tearing of a friable tumourinfiltrated lung on reexpansion trapped lung may also be caused by nonmalignant fibrotic processes eg rheumatoid pleuritis haemothorax tb the patient should be admitted and the effusion drained with a smallbore f intercostal tube if lung fully reexpands on cxr proceed to pleu rodesis see e p if lung fails to reexpand fully trapped lung cxr shows a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax consider chest drain suc tion which may encourage lung expansion and allow pleurodesis treatment options for trapped lung or failed pleurodesis pleurodesis may be successful despite only partial lung reexpansion and should still be considered if there is apposition of lung against chest wall on cxr it may be repeated if unsuccessful initially malignant pleural effusion management insertion of a longterm ipc is likely to be the preferred treatment for patients with significantly trapped lung and avoids the need for recurrent pleural aspiration see e p the most frequent complications are symptomatic loculations catheter blockage and soft tissuepleural infection can be inserted as a daycase procedure needs additional outpatient support eg trained district nurse or respiratory specialist nurse although most patients perform the drainage themselves after education repeated therapeutic pleural aspiration should be avoided unless prognosis is particularly limited month intrapleural fibrinolytics eg streptokinase iu may be of benefit in the management of multiloculated effusions resistant to drainage and pleurodesis encouraging free fluid drainage and in some cases enabling successful pleurodesis haemorrhage is a theoretical complication although it appears to be uncommon thoracoscopy enables the disruption of pleural adhesions and may have a role in facilitating pleurodesis in select patients with trapped lung pleuroperitoneal shunts are effective in patients with trapped lung or failed pleurodesis in the absence of multiple loculations shunting of fluid may occur spontaneously at high pressures or may require manipulation of a percutaneous pump chamber inserted at thoracoscopy or minithoracotomy main problem is shunt occlusion which occurs in at least of cases and necessitates shunt removal malignant spread may also occur surgical parietal pleurectomy may be performed as vats the procedure is effective in the management of refractory malignant effusions may be useful in a minority of patients with good performance status and prognosis not suitable for patients with heavily diseased visceral pleura and trapped lung consider in patients who have failed pleurodesis palliative care

dusts chest disease in coal miners it was recognized many years ago that coal miners had higher levels of respiratory disease than the general popula tion coal miners can get any or all of chronic bronchitis copd pneumoconiosis they may be eligible for compensation for all of these it can be difficult to establish the independent effects of coal dust due to high smoking rates amongst miners however it is now thought that coal dust contributes to the copd and bronchitis caused by smoking because miners have an increased prevalence of cough sputum and decreased fev when compared with nonminers the risk of cough increases with increasing dust exposure fev declines in proportion to the amount of dust exposure in smokers the response to dust is probably different to that of nonsmokers with worse disease at a given level of exposure in the past tb has also been a major problem amongst miners and their families relating to their socioeconomic conditions further information

chapter pneumoconioses coalworkers pneumoconiosis this is the condition caused by the deposition of coal dust within the lung and its associated inflammatory reaction there are two types simple pneumoconiosis which can progress to complicated pneumoconiosis also known as progressive massive fibrosis pmf these diseases are common amongst coal miners who work in poorly ven tilated conditions the risk of pneumoconiosis varies with different compo sitions of coal from different geographical areas but the larger the amount of dust to which the miner is exposed the greater the risk of developing pneumoconiosis it is now rare for miners under the age of to be diag nosed with pneumoconiosis in the uk pathology simple pneumoconiosis coal dust is inhaled into the alveolus and is engulfed by macrophages forming a black stellate lesion the coal macule this causes cytokine release and subsequent inflammatory cell recruitment leading to fibroblast activation these coal macules are found throughout the lung especially in the upper zones of the upper and lower lobes and often associated with surrounding bronchiolar dilatation they are not palpa ble regional lymph nodes also become blackened in time larger nodules develop containing reticulin and collagen between the macrophages and associated bronchiolar dilatation leading to focal emphysema is seen pmf occurs on this background but with aggregation of the fibrotic nodules to form larger lesions cm diameter macroscopically these look like large black scars extending from the lung parenchyma to the chest wall the central area of these nodules may be necrotic and the outer rim is firm and collagenous it is not understood what causes the progression of small nodules to pmf although continued exposure to coal dust in the presence of simple pneumoconiosis makes this development more likely clinical features simple pneumoconiosis is usually asymptomatic with no associated clinical signs this is a relatively benign disease pmf is usually associated with cough productive of mucoid or blackened sputum and breathlessness particularly on exertion and may in time lead to the development of cor pulmonale examination is unremarkable with no clubbing and no crepitations audible the presence of crepitations sug gests a different diagnosis coalworkers pneumoconiosis investigations cxr in simple pneumoconiosis there is nodular shadowing with nodules of varying size up to mm particularly in the upper and middle zones pneumoconiosis can be graded according to the number of different sized nodules p mm q mm and r mm nodule numbers increase with increasing dust inhalation and usually stop forming when the miner has left the work environment pmf is diagnosed when one or more opacities of cm diameter are present on the background of simple pneumoconiosis these lesions are often located in the upper lobes and enlarge becoming increasingly radiodense and clearly demarcated with time they may distort the adjacent lung and cause emphysema the lesions continue to progress out of the work environment hrct of simple pneumoconiosis shows parenchymal nodules mm in size with upper zone predominance in pmf nodules of cm are seen with irregular borders and associated parenchymal distortion and emphysema larger lesions may have cavitation and necrosis they may also have areas of calcification pfts simple pneumoconiosis fev and fvc are normal although tlco may be slightly decreased pmf signs of airway obstruction due to emphysema and restriction due to loss of lung volumes tlco is reduced management minimization of dust exposure with improved mine ven tilation respirator provision and monitoring of dust levels miners have cxr every y and are moved to less dusty work if they show signs of pneumoconiosis to prevent the development of pmf miners with signs of coalworkers pneumoconiosis are entitled to industrial injury benefits from british coal see e p no increased risk of lung cancer with pneumoconiosis or pmf caplans syndrome miners with seropositive ra or positive serum rhf can develop large welldefined nodules these occur on a background of simple pneumoconiosis and in those with a relatively low coal dust expo sure they may be multiple and may cavitate they cause no significant func tional impairment and have no malignant potential chapter pneumoconioses silicosis this is a chronic nodular densely fibrosing pneumoconiosis caused by the prolonged inhalation of silica particles long lag time of decades between exposure and clinical disease insidious onset progressive larger radiological opacities than those seen in coalworkers pneumoconiosis and more rapid progression the pattern of disease depends on the level and duration of the silicone dust exposure silica is present mostly as crystalline quartz which is mined and quarried and used in industries such as ceramics brick making and stone masonry it is becoming less prevalent in western societies due to changes in silica working conditions pathology quartz and cristobalite forms of crystalline silica cause sili cosis when they accumulate within the airways lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages engulf the particles and are removed into the lymphatic sys tem any remaining silica dust causes focal aggregations of macrophages which are in time converted into fibrosing nodules the silicotic nodule silica dust can cause surfactant secretion from the alveolus due to local irri tation this leads to further macrophage recruitment large nodules are formed by the aggregation of smaller nodules different types of silicosis there are four types and the distinction is often not clear acute silicosis is caused by intense exposure to fine dusts such as those produced by sandblasting it may become apparent in workers within a few months to a year of starting work rapid deterioration over y with treatment being ineffective rare now due to regulation of silica levels in the workplace clinically dry cough sob and a feeling of tightness on breathing deeply rapid deterioration over a few weeks fine crepitations are heard over the lower zones bilaterally respiratory failure cxr patchy bilateral lower airspace consolidation which may look like pulmonary oedema pathology irregular fibrosis adjacent to alveolar spaces filled with a lipoproteinaceous exudate similar to that found in alveolar proteinosis subacute silicosis this is the classic picture of silicosis which is now quite rare dry cough gradual onset of sob cxr upper and midzone nodules are present measuring between and mm diameter initially indistinct but become clearer with time nodules coalesce and calcify and can progress to pmf where the centre may cavitate associated calcified hilar lymphadenopathy eggshell calcification and possible pleural thickening nodules continue to develop with continued exposure but due to long lag time will also develop when patient stops being exposed in some cases with heavy exposure to silica patients may develop progressive upper zone fibrosis with sparse nodularity silicosis pfts slow decline including in tlco with mild restrictive pattern unless the silicosis has caused emphysema when obstructive or mixed picture is seen pathology dust particles within the alveoli are phagocytosed by macrophages they are removed to the lymphatics where they lodge and cause diffuse inflammatory change layers of collagen are deposited around the dust particle nodules are found within the pulmonary lobule where they cause fibrosis chronic silicosis occurs with lower dust concentrations than those seen in active silicosis appears y after first exposure cxr a few upper and midzone nodules occur which become calcified after y or so there is no associated parenchymal distortion there may be associated hilar lymphadenopathy if there is further silica exposure this disease may progress with coales cence of nodules silicotuberculosis increased likelihood of active tb infection in people with silicosis most likely due to the reactivation of quiescent lesions silica within the lung is thought to affect the efficacy of the macrophage at clearing mycobacterium tuberculosis tb can be difficult to diagnose due to multiple preexisting cxr nodules cavitation may occur haemoptysis fever worsening respiratory function and new soft cxr opacities should prompt sputum examination and bal confirmed tb should be treated with the usual three or fourdrug regime ntm infection is also more common management prevention of silicosis by monitoring and minimizing dust levels with adequate ventilation masks can be useful for shortterm use if the high levels of dust are transiently unavoidable silicosis diagnosed with history of silica exposure with amount of exposure and latency taken into account compatible imaging and lack of another diagnosis which would fit history and imaging better lung biopsy

berylliosis beryllium is a light strong industrial metal it is mined and often used as an alloy in the manufacture of fluorescent tubes for lighting and televisions radiological equipment in atomic reactors and in heatresistant ceram ics cases of berylliosis are now rare as beryllium levels have been tightly regulated to avoid sensitization however due to the long latent period between exposure and granuloma formation as well as accidental beryllium exposure cases are still occurring there are two types of disease acute beryllium disease is an acute alveolitis due to the direct effects of highdose inhaled beryllium fumes there is subsequent widespread airway oedema and pulmonary oedema which causes dyspnoea cyanosis and widespread inspiratory crepitations cxr shows pulmonary oedema it may be selflimiting if mild but if severe is usually fatal corticosteroids may prevent progression but the patient is often left with residual pulmonary impairment subacute and chronic berylliosis is a delayed hypersensitivitytype reaction due to beryllium occurring a long time after beryllium exposure in a minority of individuals it can be clinically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis it has also been seen in the wives of beryllium workers and those who live near beryllium refineries inhalation of beryllium or the exposure of beryllium to a skin abrasion causes initial sensitization in of exposed individuals only low levels of exposure are required for this there is a tcellmediated immune response with the production of numerous inflammatory cytokines which cause granulomatous inflammation following a long latent period which may be months to y plus after exposure noncaseating granulomatous tissue reactions occur in the lungs or on the skin there is a genetic predisposition to the response to beryllium exposure and it is hlamediated hladpbglu hla status could be used to identify workers at high risk of berylliosis but is not routinely used at present clinical features of chronic berylliosis symptoms dry cough dyspnoea fever malaise night sweats macular skin lesions which do not spontaneously resolve signs no clubbing or crepitations in early disease but both occur

clinicians regarding optimal pneu mothorax management the treatment algorithm presented on e p see fig is taken from the bts guidelines general management points determine whether the pneumothorax is

impending tension pneumothorax pneumothorax has a significant mortality and should be managed more aggressively treat also the underlying disease aspiration procedure described on e pp halt the procedure if painful or if the patient coughs excessively do not aspirate l of air as this suggests a large air leak and aspiration is likely to fail aspiration is successful if the lung is fully or nearly reexpanded on cxr and patient feels symptomatically better with improved physiology if initial aspiration of a pneumothorax fails a chest drain is likely to be required if benefits outweigh risks chest drainage procedure described on e pp associated with significant morbidity and even mortality and not required in the majority of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax small f drains are sufficient in most cases consider largebore f drain in pneumothorax with large air leak severe subcutaneous emphysema or in mechanically ventilated patients never clamp a bubbling chest drain risk of tension pneumothorax when air leak appears to have ceased clamping of the drain for several hours followed by repeat cxr may detect very slow or intermittent air leaks thereby avoiding inappropriate drain removal this is controversial however and should only be considered on a specialist ward with experienced nursing staff addition of washingup liquid to water in underwater seal bottle aids visualization of bubbling in very slow air leaks if water level in drain does not swing with respiration the drain is either kinked check underneath dressing as tube enters skin blocked clamped or incorrectly positioned drainage holes not in pleural space check cxr initial management heimlich flutter valves or thoracic vents are an alternative to underwater bottle drainage and are being used

lungs discuss risk of recurrence and emphasize smoking cessation if appropriate ascent to altitude with a pneumothorax is potentially hazardous guidelines recommend that patients should not fly for at least week from the resolution of spontaneous pneumothorax on cxr this time interval is arbitrary however and patients should understand that there is a high initial risk of recurrence that falls with

procedure and shorter hospital stay apical blebsbullae are stapled and mechanical pleural abrasion and or parietal pleurectomy rather than talc poudrage is usually favoured for closure of the pleural

marginally lower recurrence rates transaxillary minithoracotomy uses a relatively small axillary incision and may be a less invasive alternative to open thoracotomy chemical pleurodesis talc or tetracycline most commonly used although difficulties obtaining tetracycline procedure described on e pp can be performed via intercostal drain or at vats failure rates around and some concern about the longterm safety of intrapleural talc therefore not recommended in younger patients further management consider pleurodesis via intercostal drain only as a last resort in older patients with

disagreement exists regarding this point in the setting of a relatively asymptomatic patient with a large pneumothorax and no adverse physiology there may be no justification for intervention indeed the risk of intervention may well outweigh the risk of the pneumothorax and conservative management is preferable in our opinion breathlessness and the degree of physiological compromise are much more

infection pah is found in up to in hivpositive people more common in men and ivdus the incidence is about times higher than the general population the development of pah is independent of cd cell

proliferation portal hypertension pah is seen in up to of patients with portal hypertension of whatever cause increasing with duration of liver disease portopulmonary hypertension is probably due to

pulmonary hypertension pht features of clinical groups pht due to left heart disease pht due to lung diseases andor hypoxia the majority of patients with pht seen by a respiratory specialist will have pht due to chronic hypoxic lung disease such as copd chronic hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction and in the longer term vas cular remodelling inflammation mechanical stress of hyperinflated lungs loss of capillaries and toxic effects of cigarette smoke all contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms patients with out of proportion pht due to underlying lung disease should be referred to a specialist centrethat is dyspnoea insufficiently explained by mechanical disturbances mean pap mmhg at rest copd in this case the pht is often an incidental finding in a patient with a chronic respiratory disease a significant proportion of copd patients will develop pht possibly up to the level of pap in these patients is much lower than that seen in patients with pah copd with pht has a much poorer prognosis than copd without pht in patients with a pap mmhg the y survival is in those with a pap mmhg the y survival is whether this is due to the pht itself or whether the pht is a marker of worse hypoxia and disease severity is unclear pht in copd was thought to be due to hypoxia and emphysematous destruction of the vascular bed but neither of these factors correlates well with pap cigarette smoke may have a direct effect on the intrapulmonary vessels with the upregulation of mediators leading to aberrant vascular structural remodelling and physiological changes in vascular function ild other pulmonary diseases with mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern sleepdisordered breathing with the obesity hypoventilation syndrome not just osa see e p alveolar hypoventilation disorders eg due to neuromuscular disease both alveolar hypoxia and hypercapnia produce pulmonary vasoconstric tion thereby increasing paps chronic exposure to high altitude developmental abnormalities cteph is a frequent cause of pht with both proximal and distal clot recent data suggest that cteph occurs in up to of cases of acute nonfatal pe higher than previously thought pathogenesis is unclear but abnormalities in the clotting cascade endothelial cells or platelets may all contribute natural history of pulmonary thromboemboli is resolution or neartotal resolution of clot with restoration of normal pulmonary haemodynamics within days in of patients rightsided pressures pht features of clinical groups return to normal in most patients by weeks in cteph thromboemboli do not resolve forming endothelialized fibrotic obstructions of the pul monary vascular bed in situ thrombosis and vascular remodelling of small distal pulmonary arteries also contribute peripheral pahlike arteriopathic changes are also seen in the distal pulmonary arteries in nonobstructed areas collateral vessels from bronchial intercostal diaphragmatic and coronary arteries can develop to partially reperfuse areas distal to com plete obstruction the clinical deterioration parallels the loss of rv func tional capacity risk factors for cteph include increasing age idiopathic

diltiazem mg daily are recommended in patients with ipah with a positive vasodilator response they should then be followed closely to determine if they are longterm ccb responders with repeat rhc

epoprostenol a synthetic prostacyclin analogue potent vasodilator acting via increasing intracellular camp it is the only drug shown to improve survival in ipah in rcts it probably has its effects as

who have been accepted as suitable for transplant chapter pulmonary hypertension pht management general and surgical general management anticoagulation all patients with pht are at risk of vte and in situ pulmonary arterial thrombosis and therefore should be considered for lifelong warfarin a small thrombus can have catastrophic effects in a patient who is already severely compromised studies show an increased survival with warfarin in pht which may reflect reversal of an underlying prothrombotic state as well as the prevention of in situ thrombus formation additional beneficial effects are seen when combined with a vasodilator longterm o hypoxaemia is due to reduced cardiac output vq mismatching and righttoleft shunting through a patent foramen ovale added o may reduce any further rise

thromboendarterectomy is the treatment of choice in cteph for proximal obstructive disease this is the surgical removal of organized thrombotic material and aims to strip away the pulmonary arterial endothelium starting proximally and extending out to remove all clot in the subsegmental levels it is done on cardiopulmonary bypass with circulatory arrest the pap usually falls within h of surgery operative mortality is in experienced hands longerterm effects are not known atrial septostomy creation of a righttoleft shunt by balloon atrial septostomy aims to increase systemic blood flow by bypassing the pulmonary circulation particularly in patients with syncope or severe right heart failure it is a palliative procedure and can be used for symptom control prior to transplantation with the defect being closed at the time of transplant also used in people receiving prostanoid therapy having syncope arterial desaturation occurs following the procedure but is normally offset by the increased cardiac output seen with increased o delivery it is not indicated in severe left heart failure or in patients with impaired lv function pht management general and surgical transplantation improves survival and qol in patients with pht in those with preserved lv function lung transplant is the procedure of choice return of normal rv function is found after transplantation as for all diseases needing transplantation timing of referral and operation is crucial as organ availability is limited the incidence of obliterative bronchiolitis appears to be higher posttransplantation for pht than in transplantation for other diseases although the reason for this is uncertain prognosis in pht is variable depending on functional class haemody namic compromise with cardiac index right atrial pressure and prognosis is linked to mean pap at presentation the clinical course is one of pro gressive deterioration with episodes of acute decompensation the median survival in nyha

causes chapter pulmonary thromboembolic disease epidemiology and pathophysiology definition a pulmonary embolism pe is an obstruction of part of or the entire pulmonary vascular tree usually caused by thrombus from a distant site epidemiology the overall annual incidence is with a uk annual death rate of million the estimated overall population incidence of dvt is per person years pe may account for up to of all postoperative deaths it is the commonest cause of death following elective surgery and the commonest cause of maternal death postmortem studies have consistently shown a frequency of and large inpatient studies have shown a frequency of around with a mortality of the mortality is much higher in patients with serious underlying comorbid disease the incidence is likely to be stable but improved diagnostic methods mean that it is probably reported more frequently pathophysiology of thrombi are generated in the deep venous system of the lower limbs and pelvis probably initiated by platelet aggregation around venous valve sinuses activation of the clotting cascade leads to thrombus formation with virchows triad venous stasis injury to the vessel wall and increased blood coagulability predisposing to thrombus formation venous stasis is increased by immobility and dehydration in addition coagulation factors may be altered in various disease states eg in the acute phase response malignancy and autoimmune disease of leg thrombi embolize with a higher incidence in above than below knee clots large clots may lodge at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary arteries causing haemodynamic compromise smaller clots will travel more distally infarcting the lung and causing pleuritic pain these are more commonly multiple and bilateral and are found most often in the lower lobes where blood flow is greatest thrombi can also develop in the right heart following mi paradoxical emboli start within the venous system and enter the arterial circulation usually via a patent foramen ovale causing righttoleft shunt they typically present with features of cerebral ischaemia and these should be considered as the cause for a cerebrovascular event in the young septic emboli are found in endocarditis in association with intraventricular septal defectsav shunts or central venous access epidemiology and pathophysiology haemodynamic effects of pe depend on the size of the clot and which area of the pulmonary vascular tree it subsequently obstructs as well as the preexisting state of the myocardium as the pulmonary vasculature in a healthy lung has a large capacitance the mean pap does not rise until at least of the vascular bed has been occluded as the pap rises rv afterload increases with a resulting increase in rv end diastolic pressure the rv will start to fail as the pap reaches over mmhg acutely this causes a reduction in pulmonary blood flow leading to reduced lv filling and a reduction in systemic bp adequate blood volume for rightsided heart filling is vital the effects are much worse if rightsided filling cannot be maintained eg if the patient is dehydrated hypovolaemic or erect arterial hypoxia results from several factors reduced cardiac output consequently a low mixed venous pao a higher perfusion to the remaining alveoli resulting in inadequate oxygenation of this blood hypoxia will be worse if there is a larger premorbid vq spread eg in the elderly and in those with preexisting lung disease the increased blood flow with a lower mixed venous pao passing through low vq areas overwhelms their oxygenating ability it is therefore possible for a young person with healthy lungs to have a normal pao and aa gradient following a significant pe death is due to circulatory collapse from the inability of the right heart to acutely maintain an adequate cardiac output chapter pulmonary thromboembolic disease aetiology risk factors can be divided into major and minor factors see table this division is important for an

unless in specific circumstances see further text on thrombophilia testing as the number needed to test to prevent an episode of vte would be very high in addition detecting a heritable thrombophilia

venous thrombosis with no obvious risk factors thrombosis to pregnancy ocp hrt thrombosis at an unusual sitecerebral mesenteric portal or hepatic veins do not offer testing in those continuing

clinical features acute pe typically presents in four main ways pulmonary infarction and haemoptysis pleuritic pain abgs may be normal and ecg changes uncommon localizing signs may be present eg pleural rub isolated dyspnoea in defined as acute breathlessness in the absence of haemorrhage or circulatory collapse the thrombus is more likely to be central with hypoxia on blood gases the patient may have suddenonset and unexplained breathlessness in the presence of risk factors for vte there may also be angina from increased right heart work and inadequate o delivery to its muscle collapse poor reserve in may be due to a small pe often in an elderly patient with limited cardiorespiratory reserve these patients can rapidly decompensate with even a relatively small pe the clinical findings may be nonspecific and reflect more the underlying disease process and thus fail to arouse suspicion of a pe circulatory collapse in a previously well patient hypotension loss of consciousness in usually due to extensive pulmonary artery occlusion from massive pe causing marked hypoxia and hypocapnia due to hyperventilation and acute right heart failure with chest pain due to right heart angina raised jvp and fainting on sitting up ecg may be normal show sinus tachycardia or right heart strain echo shows pht and rv failure these patients have the highest mortality up to chronic thromboembolic disease this typically presents with more insidious onset of breathlessness over the course of weeks to months due to increasing load of recurrent smallvolume clots see e pp

pressure deterioration in cardiac output on sitting up when filling pressure falls chapter pulmonary thromboembolic disease diagnosis of acute pe the diagnosis of a pe can be difficult and involves a clinical assessment of probability this takes risk factors clinical presentation and clinical signs into account investigations are then performed that may add weight to the clinical decision rather than being standalone diagnostic tests therefore the estimation of the pretest clinical probability of dvt and pe is of vital importance in interpreting the results of the tests performed pretest

should always be used with the ddimer result ddimer has an important role in diagnosing and excluding pe and should only be used with a pretest clinical probability assessment following careful clinical evaluation by an experienced clinician ddimers are sensitive for dvt and thromboembolism but not specific they are rarely in the normal range in cases of acute thromboembolism but are not a valid screening test for pe alone ddimers are generated as a result of fibrinolysis which occurs in many clinical situations including sepsis postsurgery pneumonia neoplasia inflammatory disease pregnancy and advanced age only a normal result which virtually excludes pe is of clinical value diagnosis of acute pe an abnormal result however high does not necessarily imply a significantly increased probability of pe the sensitivity ranges from to depending on the assay used these should be known before incorporating into diagnostic algorithms ddimer testing for excluding pe has been validated as an outpatient test but not in inpatient groups assessment and documentation of pretest clinical probability in pe is para mount this enables accurate clinical assessment and may obviate

uncertain ctpa should be performed within h in suspected massive pe and within h of suspected nonmassive pe the sensitivity and specificity of ctpa depends on the location of the emboli with lower

lung imaging in those with clinical dvt a single examination is not adequate to exclude subclinical dvt venography is more sensitive it is safe to withhold anticoagulation in patients with suspected

need for further imaging up to of patients with a clinically obvious dvt will have a highprobability vq scan conventional pulmonary angiogram is available in a few specialist centres only where catheter fragmentation of large clots may be of therapeutic benefit now mostly superseded by ctpa ct venography is an emerging area it can be combined with ctpa to image the pelvic leg veins

controversial most would only recommend thrombolysis for patients with clinically massive pe increasing evidence sug gests that individuals with a large clot volume in the absence of haemody namic

severity assessment cap has a wide range of severity an assessment of severity enables the most appropriate care to be delivered in the most appropriate clinical setting early identification of patients at high risk of death allows early decisions about hospital admission and possible need for assisted ventilation to be made assessment of disease severity depends on the experience of the clinician a number of predictive assessment models have been trialled these severity models should be regarded as adjuncts to clinical assessment and regular reassessment of the disease is needed poor prognostic factors those with two or more adverse prognostic factors are at high risk of death and should be managed as for severe cap age coexisting disease including cardiac disease diabetes copd

general points early antibiotic administration is associated with an improved outcome antibiotics given before admission can influence the results of subsequent microbiological investigations but this

of recent antibiotic treatment local policy and known local flora culture data empirical antibiotic choice often includes coverage for anaerobes and mrsa legionella if long stay p aeruginosa and acinetobacter length of treatment depends on the clinical response with one trial showing that day treatment had similar efficacy to day treatment although patients with p aeruginosa infection had a greater risk of recur rence following discontinuation of antibiotics at days failure to respond should lead to a change of antibiotics and a search for additional infection or another cause for the radiographic infiltrate further cultures should be sent chapter respiratory infectionbacterial aspiration pneumonia definition pneumonia that follows the aspiration of exogenous material or endogenous secretions into the lower respiratory tract epidemiology aspiration pneumonia is the commonest cause of death in patients with dysphagia due to neurological disorders and is the cause of up to of pneumonias in nursing home residents it occurs in about of patients admitted to hospital with a drug overdose pathophysiology microaspiration is common in healthy individuals but for an aspiration pneumonia to occur there must be compromise of the normal defences protecting the lower airways ie glottic closure cough reflex with inoculation of the lower respiratory tract of a signifi cant amount of material most pneumonias are a result of aspiration of microorganisms from the oral cavity or nasopharynx situations predisposing to aspiration pneumonia reduced conscious level cough reflex and impaired glottic closure alcohol drug overdose postseizure postanaesthesia massive cerebrovascular accident cva dysphagia motor neurone disease mnd following a neurological event those with impaired swallow reflex postcva are seven times more likely to develop a pneumonia than those in whom the gag reflex is unimpaired upper gi tract disease surgery to the stomach or oesophagus mechanical impairment of glottic or cardiac sphincter closure eg tracheostomy nasogastric feeding bronchoscopy pharyngeal anaesthesia increased reflux largevolume vomiting largevolume ng feed feeding gastrostomy recumbent position nursing home residents the risk of aspiration is lower in those without teeth who receive aggressive oral hygiene there is a higher incidence of silent aspiration in the otherwise healthy elderly strong correlation between volume of aspirate and the risk of developing pneumonia aspiration pneumonia chapter respiratory infectionbacterial aspiration pneumonia clinical features three pulmonary syndromes result from aspiration the amount and nature of the aspirated material the site and frequency of the aspiration and the hosts response to it will determine which pulmonary syndrome occurs chemical pneumonitis this is aspiration of substances toxic to the lower airways in the absence of bacterial infection this causes a chemical burn of the tracheobronchial tree causing an intense parenchymal inflammatory reaction with release of inflammatory mediators that may lead to ards animal studies show that an inoculum with a ph of relatively large volume about ml in adults is needed to initiate an inflammatory reaction animal models show rapid pathological changes within min with atelectasis pulmonary haemorrhage and pul monary oedema this was first described by mendelson referring to the aspiration of sterile gastric contents and its toxic effects the original case series was in obstetric anaesthesia clinical features rapid onset of symptoms with breathlessness within h lowgrade fever severe hypoxaemia and diffuse lung infiltrates involving dependent segments cxr changes within h treatment if aspiration is observedsuction andor bronchoscopy to

or factor in the aspiration aciddamaged lung is more susceptible to the effects of bacterial infection up to will develop bacterial infection activity against gramnegative and anaerobic organisms is needed eg cefuroxime plus metronidazole or penicillin plus clindamycin bacterial infection aspiration of bacteria normally resident in the upper airways or stomach the normal bacterial flora are anaerobes in a host susceptible to aspiration and less virulent than the bacteria causing cap clinical features depend on the infecting organism cough fever purulent sputum breathlessness the process

coamoxiclav clindamycin or a carbapenem swallow assessmentneurological review if no obvious underlying cause found mechanical obstruction aspiration of matter that is not directly toxic to the lung may lead to damage by causing airway obstruction or reflex airway closure causative agents include saline barium most ingested fluids including water gastric contents with a ph mechanical obstruction such as occurs in drowning or those who are unable to clear a potential inoculum eg neurological deficit impaired cough reflex reduced conscious level inhalation of an object with the severity of the obstruction depending on the size and site of the aspirated particle this is commoner in children but does occur in adults eg teeth peanuts treatment tracheal suction remove obstructing object if necessary no further treatment is needed if no cxr infiltrates chapter respiratory infectionbacterial lung abscess clinical features definition a localized area of lung suppuration leading to necrosis

is likely to be taken in a semirecumbent position so an airfluid level may not be visible of abscesses are in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe or the apical basal segments of either lower lobe ct is useful if the diagnosis is in doubt and cannot be confirmed from the cxr appearance or if the clinical response to treatment is inadequate it can also help to define the exact position of the abscess which may be useful for physiotherapy or if surgery is being consideredrarely needed ct also is useful to differentiate an abscess from a pleural collectiona lung abscess appears as a rounded intrapulmonary mass with no compression of adjacent lung with a thickened irregular wall making an acute angle at its contact with the chest wall an empyema typically has a lenticular shape and compresses adjacent lung which creates an obtuse angle as it follows the contour of the chest wall ct can determine the presence of obstructing endobronchial disease due to malignancy or foreign body and may be useful in defining the extent of disease in a very sick patient who has had significant haemoptysis even with ct differentiating an abscess from a cavitating malignancy can be very difficult no radiological features differentiate them microbiology commonly mixed infection usually anaerobes the most common organisms are those colonizing the oral cavity and gingival

many years persontoperson transmission does not occur considerable recent interest has focused on the use of anthrax in bioterrorism five envelopes containing anthrax spores were sent through the usa postal service in and there were confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax including five deaths and seven confirmed cases of cutaneous anthrax a previous outbreak occurred in sverdlovsk in the former soviet union in following the release of spores from a biological weapons plant and resulted in deaths anthrax infection also occurs very rarely in association with occupational exposure to bacillus anthracis in animal wool or hides the majority of occupational cases result in cutaneous disease and a diagnosis of inhalational anthrax strongly suggests a bioterrorist attack clinical features inhalational anthrax incubation period is variable although in the usa in it typically ranged days following exposure from opening mail patients typically experience a prodrome of flulike symptoms such as fever and cough gi symptoms vomiting diarrhoea abdominal pain drenching sweats and altered mental status are often prominent symptoms breathlessness fever and septic shock develop several days

the infection site a necrotic ulcer with a black centre and often surrounding oedema subsequently develops systemic symptoms such as fever and sweats may be present investigations bacillus anthracis grows on conventional media and is readily cultured if sampling precedes antibiotic treatment a definitive diagnosis requires specialized laboratory tests eg pcr immunohistochemistry of biopsy samples

this can be a multisystem disorder with aspergillus invading almost any part of the body semiinvasive aspergillosis a much lowergrade process than invasive aspergillus pneumonia usually seen in older individuals with no apparent immunosuppression but usually some underlying chronic lung disease aspergilloma where aspergillus lives and grows as a separate ball of fungus in a preexisting lung cavity

asthma and positive igg precipitins to aspergillus atopic allergy to fungal spores approximately of asthmatics are skin prickpositive to aspergillus spe cies compared with about to house dust mite it is assumed that this allergy contributes to allergic inflammation in the airways but in the few relevant studies symptoms have not always correlated with exposure however in some studies asthma

exposure results from working with mouldy vegetable mat ter eg in compost heaps during late summerearly autumn asthma and positive igg precipitins to aspergillus definition asthmatics with ige responses to aspergillus can also develop igg antibodies precipitins why this happens is not clear aspergillus hyphae can sometimes be isolated from the sputum and it has been sug gested that

investigations associated features may include serum ige ngml blood eosinophilia l skin prick ve to aspergillus igg precipitins to aspergillus many different allergenic proteins long history of asthma perhaps recently deteriorated management may only require an increase in inhaled steroids however there is a suggestion that courses of oral steroids are particularly effective and may prevent progression to bronchiectasis see next section steroids limit the hosts immunological response but do not seem to lead to aspergillus invasion of the tissues poorly documented evidence of improve ment with antifungal agents such as itraconazole therefore suspect this development in a patient with longterm asthma whose control deteriorates with cxr changes lge and lgg to aspergillus eosinophilia and perhaps hyphae in the sputum chapter respiratory infectionfungal allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis definition this condition is probably an extension of exuberant ige and igg reaction to aspergillus where the inflammatory response to the aspergillus in the airways provokes a more exuberant response with dam age to the bronchial walls and bronchiectasis some authors reserve the use of the term abpa for when bronchiectasis is present others may include exuberant ige and igg reaction to aspergillus and subdivide into abpas seropositive only and abpacb central bronchiectasis the prevalence of abpa in asthmatic populations has varied considerably between studies and clearly will depend on whether the definition includes bronchiectasis or not it probably occurs in about of asthmatics a related condition occurs in patients with cf where it appears about have evidence of colonization and potential ongoing damage pathophysiology the factors promoting the evolution from atopic asthmatic to abpa are not known a particular hla association has been shown with the suggestion that a cdth response to a particular aspergillus antigen asp f antigen with release of il and il may be critical proteolytic enzymes are released by aspergillus as part of its exo phytic feeding strategy and these enzymes may damage airway mucosa however most believe that the damage results from

of the body the species most commonly seen are aspergillus fumigatus flavus terreus and niger mortality is very high the source of aspergillus is unclear but has been found in hospital water supplies pathogenesis alveolar macrophages probably normally destroy aspergillus spores macrophage failure may allow more spores to germinate and any subsequent invasion with hyphae seems to be prevented by neu trophils inadequate neutrophil function allows invasion across tissue planes and into vessels with infarction and further spread throughout the body there is some evidence that cmv may inactivate

invasive pulmonary aspergillosis definition this entity is poorly defined but it is clear that a lowgrade chronic invasion of aspergillus into airway walls and surrounding lung can occur in the original descriptions some cause of mild immunoincompetence was present such as diabetes steroid therapy chronic lung disease poor nutrition etc previous asthma is not usually present unlike abpa pathogenesis it is assumed that this form of aspergillosis results from lowered immunity in those with a tendency to make th eosinophilic responses to antigens there is infiltration of hyphae into lung tissue rang ing from minor patchy consolidation to multiple cavities there is little if any angioinvasion it is assumed that the fungal digestive proteases gradually do the damage rather than the hosts immunological response clinical features investigations sputum samples may allow isolation of hyphae ct will show an airwaycentred type of picture with treeinbud appearance with increasing severity this gives way to denser areas and small cavities that occasionally may contain a fungus ball likely to have igg precipitins to aspergillus but not always management on the assumption that mild immune suppression is the dominant cause steroids are not usually recommended for fear of further immune suppression this is in contrast to abpa where the damage is due to the hosts immune defence mechanisms oral treatment with voricona zole is usually appropriate but iv therapy is required for severely ill patients alternative treatment options are as for invasive aspergillosis suspect

changes semiinvasive aspergillosis chapter respiratory infectionfungal aspergillomamycetoma known as chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis when there are multiple cavities definition the term aspergilloma is used to describe a ball of fungal hyphae within a cavity in the lung it is assumed that this is colonization of a prior cavity saphrophytic infection rather than arrested invasion aspergillomas can occur in other organs including the pleural space chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis ccpa demonstrates multiple cavities often with aspergillomas in association with pulmonary and sys temic symptoms and raised inflammatory markers usually associated with prolonged symptoms and defects in innate immunity pathogenesis cavities can occur in the lung following a variety of insults such as tb sarcoid ordinary pneumonialung abscess treated tumours and cf fungal spores entering the cavity germinate and survive in a rela tively protected environment the ball consists of hyphae inflammatory cells fibrin and debris around the cavity is an intense inflammatory response often with considerable extra vascularization from bronchial arteries and occasional fungal hyphae clinical features aspergillomas are often asymptomatic up to will present with haemoptysis assumed to come from damaged vessels on the inner surface of the cavity wall via a communication with a

in other aspergillus diseases management single aspergilloma may not require treatment consideration of surgical resection systemic symptoms of fever and malaise may be hard to ascribe to a mycetoma and require a therapeutic trial of voriconazole itraconazole the most significant complication is lifethreatening haemoptysis the emergency management of haemoptysis is described on e p itraconazole or voriconazole will not eradicate the fungus but seem to reduce cavity size and lessen the tendency to haemoptysis it is assumed that they kill any fungus in the walls and inhibit growth in the cavity aspergillomamycetoma ccpa treat with itraconazole or voriconazole avoid surgery associated with high morbidity and mortality with complications including haemorrhage bronchopleural fistulae and soiling of the pleural space haemoptysis bronchial arteriograms should reveal a leash of vessels supplying part of the cavity wall that can be embolized even if not actively bleeding shortterm success rate is good long term less good surgery can be difficult as mycetomas may be stuck to the chest wall problems of seeding the pleural space are seen less often than in the past probably due to better antifungal agents a few case reports exist of successful reduction of haemoptysis with radiotherapy older approaches involving intracavity injections of amphotericin are rarely used now although a recent case series of patients seemed promising overview of aspergillus lung disease the essential differences between the aspergillus lung diseases depends on whether the damage to the lung is mediated by host defence mecha nisms atopic asthma flitting consolidation abpa possibly aspergilloma or by the fungus own digestive proteolytic enzymes invasive aspergillosis semiinvasive aspergilloma these two disease states are clearly different but there probably exists a continuum between each of the subdivisions within each group and the dominant mechanism in aspergilloma is not entirely clear

from infection with the fungus pneumocystis jirovecii previously termed pneumocystis carinii pneumocystis jirovecii is widespread in the environment and most people are infected by the age of y pcp is thought however to follow new infection rather than reactivation of latent infection most cases of infection are likely to be persontoperson airborne transmission rather than environmental causes risk factors for pcp include hiv infection particularly with cd count l treatment with chemotherapy especially fludara bine corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents and malnutrition in children neutropenia does not appear to be a particular risk factor pcp occurring in the setting of aids is associated with both a greater number of organisms and fewer inflammatory cells in the lungs when compared with infection associated with other causes of immunocompromise pcp is much less common following the routine use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in hiv and posttransplantation although cases still occur eg in patients presenting with advanced hiv or in those noncompliant with prophylaxis the threshold steroid dose for predisposition to pcp is unclear although a dose equivalent to mg prednisolone or greater for weeks appears to significantly increase risk the risk is likely also to reflect the underlying condition eg pcp may develop in patients with haematological malignancy taking as little as mg prednisolone daily pcp often appears to present as immunosuppressant drug doses are tapered or increased clinical features gradual onset of dry cough and exertional breath lessness sometimes with retrosternal tightness fever and tachypnoea may occur chest examination is typically normal may present with pneumotho rax extrapulmonary disease is very rare investigations cxr pattern is classically of bilateral perihilar infiltrates that progress to alveolar shadowing less common patterns include small nodular infiltrates or focal consolidation cxr is normal in about pleural effusions are very rare ct is not routinely required except in cases of a normal cxr when it may demonstrate a bilateral groundglass pattern or cystic lesions hypoxia is common desaturation on exercise may suggest the diagnosis in atrisk individuals with normal saturations at rest white blood count is usually normal serum ldh is typically raised sensitive but nonspecific induced sputum see e p has a diagnostic yield of about in hiv infection but is much less sensitive when performed in the setting of nonhiv immunocompromise where the organism burden is lower it should not be performed on the open ward or outpatient department pneumocystis pneumonia pcp diagnosis bronchoscopy with bal is the diagnostic investigation of choice in nonhivinfected patients and in patients with hiv in whom induced sputum analysis is nondiagnostic bal with silver or immunofluorescent staining has a specificity of nearly and sensitivity of this sensitivity is lower in nonhivinfected immunocompromised patients reflecting their lower pathogen loads transbronchial lung biopsy has a slightly higher sensitivity around but is associated with an increased risk of complications so is reserved for cases where bal is nondiagnostic surgical lung biopsy may be required for diagnosis in a minority of hivnegative patients chapter respiratory infectionfungal pcp treatment antimicrobial liaise with infectious diseases or hiv specialist highdose cotrimoxazole trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole remains the drug of choice administer mgkg daily in four divided doses po or iv dilute mg ampoules in at least ml glucose infuse over min use iv route initially and then po during clinical improvement po may be used initially in mild cases side effects eg rash nausea vomiting blood disorders are common particularly in hivinfected patients consider routine use of antiemetics secondline choices if intolerant or unresponsive to cotrimoxazole include iv pentamidine clindamycin and primaquine dapsone and trimethoprim atovaquone all treatments should be for weeks if pcp is strongly suspected and the patient is unwell treatment can be started immediately as bal pneumocystis stains remain positive for up to weeks empirical treatment is also required in the occasional situation where the diagnosis is suspected but bronchoscopy is nondiagnostic or not tolerated in cases of hiv presenting with pcp early introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has been contentious with theoretical risks of drug interactions increasing toxicities and the potential for iris however a randomized trial and a retrospective analysis both demonstrated a reduction in mortality when haart was started within weeks of pcp treatment suspected iris should be treated with corticosteroids reintroduction of pcp therapy steroids highdose steroids prednisolone mg bd po or iv hydrocortisone are recommended for all patients in respiratory failure treat at high dose for days taper dose over weeks eg prednisolone mg daily for days then mg daily for days supportive therapy hypoxia is common administer supplementary highflow o and consider use of cpap mechanical ventilation if considered appropriate may be required make this decision prior to initiating cpap outcome mortality in the setting of aids but in patients with other forms of immunocompromise probably reflecting the adverse consequences of the greater pulmonary inflammatory response to pneumocystis which is observed in nonhiv immunocompromise mortality from pcp requiring mechanical ventilation in hivinfected patients is about although may be significantly higher in patients with low cd counts pcp treatment relapse rate in aids is high in y so prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole is recommended prophylaxis is offered to hivpositive patients with cd count l the indications for prophylaxis in nonhiv patients are less well defined consider prophylaxis for patients who are likely to receive high doses of prednisolone for prolonged periods future developments the effect of coinfection with cmv on the outcome of pcp in hivinfected patients is unclear in patients with severe pcp treated with steroids the presence of cmv in bal fluid is associated with a worse outcome the role of anticmv therapy such as ganciclovir in such cases is unknown the use of pcr to detect pneumocystis may further increase diagnostic sensitivity although in a proportion of cases detection using pcr is not accompanied by evidence of clinical infection and appears to represent colonization it is unclear if asymptomatic carriage precedes infection in such patients and the consequences of carriage in immunocompetent individuals are also unknown pneumocystis is one of only a handful of cells known to be unable to synthesize the metabolic intermediate molecule sadenosylmethionine adomet and as a result must scavenge this molecule from its host in a small study lower plasma levels of adomet were demonstrated in pcp when compared with healthy controls and individuals with other pulmonary infections suggesting a possible role for adomet in diagnosis this finding has not yet been replicated in a larger study however further information

india ink stain on csf or latex agglutination test for capsular antigen in bal or pleural fluid blood or csf serum cryptococcal antigen test is extremely sensitive and specific for the diagnosis stains and culture of sputum blood urine or bal fluid positive culture from sputum may indicate colonization rather than active disease and should be interpreted in the clinical context treatment of cryptococcal infection in the immunocompromised is with amphotericin b iv and flucytosine iv for weeks followed by flucona zole the natural history of disease in immunocompetent patients is poorly understood and observation alone is often recommended disseminated disease may occur however and some experts advise treatment with fluconazole candidal pneumonia candidal pneumonia candida occurs as part of the normal human flora and is found in the gi tract and on the skin invasive disease may occur in the immunocompromised particularly in neutropenic patients prophylaxis with fluconazole is used following bone marrow transplantation candida is often isolated from respiratory secretions but very rarely causes respiratory disease haematogenous seeding to the lungs causing infiltrates or enlarging nodules may occur with disseminated candidal infection risk factors for candidaemia include immunocompromise central venous lines parenteral nutrition and gi surgery in lung transplant recipients a positive donor tracheal culture for candida is a marker for posttransplant candidal infection the clinical and radiological features of pulmonary involvement are nonspecific extrapulmonary manifestations of infection are common eg skin eye hepatic or cns involvement candidaemia is typically associated with a high fever definitive diagnosis of pulmonary disease requires

blastomycosis coccidioidomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis endemic fungi can rarely present in nonendemic areas and diagnosis is often delayed because of their nonspecific and varied clinical features and the failure to obtain a detailed travel history fungal infection may mimic other diseases such as tb and lung cancer often leading to inappropriate investigations and treatment fungal infections can also cause granulomata on lung biopsy which sometimes results in diagnostic confusion eg with sarcoidosis infection in immunocompetent individuals is usually either asymptomatic or mild and selflimiting although severe infection may rarely occur in apparently immunocompetent individuals outbreaks of disease may occur as well as sporadic cases unlike invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis where neutrophils are the key host defence mechanism tcellmediated immunity is essential for defence against the endemic mycoses patients with impaired tcellmediated immunity eg aids

fungus is common unlike in histoplasmosis and facilitates diagnosis culture of sputum has a high yield and is diagnostic in most cases of acute pulmonary disease multiple specimens may be required however a drawback of sputum culture is that several weeks may be required before the fungus is identified cytological examination of sputum may provide a rapid diagnosis if the examiner is trained appropriately and alerted to the possible diagnosis bronchoscopy has a similar diagnostic yield to sputum culture in one study and is recommended for patients with negative sputum results note that lidocaine may inhibit the fungal growth and minimal concentrations should be used more invasive procedures such as surgical lung biopsy or thoracoscopy are only rarely needed histological specimens require particular stains eg silver stain to facilitate identification of the fungus currently available serological tests lack sensitivity and are rarely helpful endemic mycoses blastomycosis

caucasians around of cases are coinfected with hiv tb is concentrated in the major cities with of cases in london pathophysiology the disease is spread by airborne droplets containing mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb droplets remain airborne for hours after expectoration because of their small size infectious droplets are inhaled and become lodged in the distal airways mtb is taken up by alveolar mac rophages triggering the innate immune system and spreads via the lym phatics to hilar lymph nodes later a cellmediated immune process leads to granuloma formation by activated tlymphocytes and macrophages which limits further bacterial replication and disease spread most over immunocompetent individuals successfully contain the infection either eliminated or contained in a latent state progress to active disease progressive tb many factors influence whether or not infection leads to active disease including age host immunity and time since infection risk highest in first few years after infection the estimated lifetime risk of clinical disease in a child newly infected with mtb is about active disease occurs when the hosts immune response is unable to contain mtb replication with absent or poorly formed granulomas active disease occurs most often in the lung parenchyma due to high o content in which the bacillus grows well and hilar lymph nodes it can occur in any organ

the mycobacterium cultured turns out to be an ntm drug treatment is usually in two phases phase initial intensive phase designed to kill actively growing bacteria this phase lasts months and shortens the duration of infectivity at least three drugs are needed eg isoniazid rifampicin and pyrazinamide and guidelines recommend four drugs with ethambutol added because of risks of drug resistance phase continuation phase is usually with two drugs typically isoniazid and rifampicin for months fewer bacteria are present in this phase and there is therefore a lower chance that drugresistant mutants will emerge so drug resistance is less of a problem compliance is of major importance and all patients should have a risk assess ment for treatment adherence if the clinical response is not

contribute to death in tb treatment followup cxr is advised at the end of therapy for pulmonary disease relapse is uncommon in those compliant with standard treatment regimes in the uk therefore longterm followup is not recommended followup at months after treatment completion is recommended for patients treated for drugresistant tb relapse after good compliance is usually due to fully

hivpositive patients chapter respiratory infectionmycobacterial tb in pregnancy there is no increased risk of developing clinical disease in pregnancy presentation is the same as in nonpregnant individuals but the diagnosis may be delayed by the nonspecific nature of the symptoms in the early stages of disease with malaise and fatigue being common in the early stages of pregnancy a cxr is more likely to be delayed the tuberculin skin test result is not affected by pregnancy this applies to hivpositive and negative subjects a negative skin test should not lead to bcg vaccination as live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy in this situation the skin test should be repeated after delivery and bcg given then after a second negative test tb outcome in pregnancy if diagnosed in the first trimester the disease has the same outcome as for nonpregnant women if diagnosed in the second or third trimester studies give more variable outcomes some studies show a good foetal outcome some show higher rates of smallfordate babies preeclampsia and spontaneous abortion but these effects tend to be related to late diagnosis and incomplete drug treatment some studies also show a poorer foetal outcome in extrapulmonary disease late diagnosis of pulmonary tb can lead to a fold increased obstetric mortality and fold increased preterm labour in some developing countries treatment in

used igra two blood tests tspottb oxford immunotec ltd and quantiferontb gold qiagen are available and are based on the detection of ifnγ released by tcells in response to mtbspecific antigens the tspottb test is an elispot test counting individual tcells producing ifnγ the quantiferon test is based on a whole blood elisa and meas ures the ifnγ level in the supernatant of the stimulated whole blood sam ple both assays use two proteins esat and cfp encoded by a unique genomic sequence of mtb which is absent from m bovis bcg and the majority of opportunistic mycobacteria these proteins are the main targets for ifnγsecreting tlymphocytes in individuals infected with mtb these tests have several advantages over the tuberculin skin test no return visit for test reading is required the result is available the next day and repeated testing does not cause boosting with both tests blood must be collected in a heparinized tube and processed within h of venepuncture the blood should be transferred to the laboratory at room temperature both tests are more sensitive for the diagnosis of latent tb than the tuberculin skin test particularly in children and hivpositive individuals and on current available evidence there is little difference between the two although the tspottb test may be more sensitive in hivpositive individuals hiv infection the tuberculin skin test may be falsely negative and radiological changes may be atypical current who guidelines recom mend isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for hivinfected patients in lowincome highburden countries with positive or unknown skin tests in the absence of active disease uptake of this recommendation is slow partly because of the difficulties in distinguishing active from latent disease in the setting of hiv coinfection and concern regarding emergence of resistant strains exposure to smearpositive disease should lead to chemoprophylaxis in the latent tb infection absence of active disease recommended followup is at and months for those not receiving chemoprophylaxis but who were eligible for it hivpositive patients should receive longterm followup as part of their ongoing hiv management chemoprophylaxis is given to contacts or screened immigrants with a strongly positive skin test or positive igra who have no radiological or clinical evidence of active disease the risk of developing disease after exposure depends on a number of factors including bcg and hivimmune status and whether infection was recent younger patients must have had relatively recent infection and have a longer life expectancy from

starting antitnfα therapy should be investigated promptly both those with an abnormal cxr consistent with previous tb or those who have a prior history of extrapulmonary tb who have not had adequate treatment need to have active tb excluded by appropriate investigations they should receive chemoprophylaxis before antitnfα therapy commences assuming active disease is not identified if there is clinical concern because of the delay in starting antitnfα treatment a shorter course of chemoprophylaxis can be given but this may be more toxic any tb diagnosed pulmonary or extrapulmonary should be treated with standard chemotherapy if active tb is present patients should receive a minimum of months antitb chemotherapy before starting antitnfα therapy if the cxr is normal the tuberculin test or igra may be helpful if the patient is not on immunosuppressants the skin test must be interpreted knowing the bcg history a tuberculin skin test is unhelpful tb and antitnfα treatment if the patient

occupational contacts examination is usually only needed if the index case was smearpositive or if the contacts are at high risk this also applies if of the close contacts have been infected ie the index case is considered highly infectious of tb is diagnosed by contact tracing with disease occurring in about of contacts smearnegative patients are much less infectious but contact tracing is still recommended in these patients contacts should be traced for the period the index case has been infectious or for months prior to the first positive sputum or culture if the time period is

posttreatment c may represent the onset of systemic bcg infection or hypersensitivity and hospital admission is recommended bcg sepsis is reported in around with ten deaths attributed to intravesical bcg to date the major differential diagnosis is gramnegative sepsis thus patients should be treated with broadspectrum antibiotics lateronset symptoms at up to weeks though may occur much earlier including fever malaise arthralgia and breathlessness may represent systemic bcg infection though there is debate as to whether these sorts of systemic symptoms are due to systemic bcg infection or

respiratory infectionmycobacterial future developments in tb molecular techniques are increasingly employed in tb diagnostics and for the detection of drug resistance and recently the use of whole genome sequencing for rapid mtb antibiotic susceptibility testing was reported whole genome sequencing of mycobacteria also allows delineation of tb outbreaks current clinical trials are investigating the use of fluoroquinolones and higher doses of rifamycins as part of shorter treatment regimens a number of antibiotics are under investigation for the treatment of drugresistant disease including bedaquiline the nitroimidazoles delamanid and pa and linezolid vaccines are currently in clinical trials most recently a large placebocontrolled trial showed a lack of efficacy of the vaccine mvaa against tb in infants the role of vitamin d supplementation in the treatment and prevention of tb needs further assessment additional treatments aimed at immunomodulation may facilitate bacillary clearance and increase cure rates particularly in mdr disease small studies suggest that il and nebulized interferon gammab may have some benefit in this setting and in patients with hiv coinfection a larger study in hivnegative patients with pulmonary tb has not shown improved bacillary clearance in mdrtb however there may be greater benefits of treatment a change is planned to roll out the uk

clinical context compatible histopathology granuloma tous inflammation when available further supports a decision to com mence treatment hrct may be useful in facilitating treatment decisions as an abnormal baseline hrct consistent with ntm infection appears to be predictive of disease progression management the decision to treat is complex and is based on the likelihood of clinical disease weighed against the side effects and potential toxicity of treatment no need to notify or contacttrace as there is low risk of crossinfection typical drug regimens for specific ntm species are described on e pp prolonged courses of treatment are required and drug side effects frequently limit therapy avoid macrolide monotherapy which encourages macrolide resistance be alert to the possibility of drug interactions in the setting of hiv there are potential drug interactions between rifampicin macrolides and protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nnrtis rifampicin induces liver enzymes and therefore the elimination of other drugs eg oral contraceptives warfarin phenytoin prednisolone ciclosporin etc may be increased macrolides may cause qt interval prolongation particularly when taken alongside other qtprolonging drugs curative therapy is not always possible reflecting antibiotic resistance in the ntm species drug intolerance due to

avium subspecies as well as m intracellulare it is also referred to as m avium intracellulare mai classical presentations include upper lobe fibrocavitary disease in elderly smokers and nodularbronchiectatic disease in nonsmoking initial treatment should be triple therapy with a macrolide clarithromycin or azithromycin rifampicin and ethambutol a three times weekly regimen may be used in less severe disease consider adding nebulizediv amikacin or iv streptomycin in severe usually cavitary disease antibiotic susceptibility testing is not predictive of clinical response in mac with the exception of macrolide susceptibility and so routine susceptibility testing of mac isolates is performed for clarithromycin only macrolide resistance is associated with a poor prognosis and its management is complexseek microbiology advice the major risk factor for macrolide resistance is macrolide monotherapy and macrolides should never be used as monotherapy for treatment of mac antibiotic treatment should be continued for months of negative sputum cultures whilst on therapy mac is the leading cause of ntm infection in the setting of hiv and may occur late in the disease when cd count or during the first months of art disease is rarely confined to the lungs in this setting and lymphadenitis and disseminated infection are common mycobacterium kansasii m kansasii classically presents with progressive upper lobe fibrocavitary disease similar to tb and isolation of m kansasii is usually associated with disease rather than reflecting contamination treatment is usually with rifampicin ethambutol and isoniazid for a minimum of months of negative sputum cultures clarithromycin and moxifloxacin may be useful agents eg for rifampicinresistant isolates usually good response to treatment y cure and relapse with full compliance mycobacterium malmoense m malmoense typically causes cavitary disease often in patients with underlying copd and isolation of m malmoense is usually associated with disease rather than contamination treatment is usually with drugs including ethambutol and rifampicin and often a macrolide for months mycobacterium xenopi m xenopi typically causes upper lobe cavitary disease resembling tb treatment regimens include ethambutol isoniazid and rifampicin for at least months macrolides may be useful disease may progress despite treatment and mortality appears to be relatively high ntm species and lung disease mycobacterium gordonae m gordonae is frequently isolated from sputum but is usually a contaminant and only rarely causes progressive lung disease rapidly growing species mycobacterium abscessus m abscessus comprises three species m abscessus sensu stricto m massiliense and m boletii which may differ in treatment response with a better prognosis in m massiliense compared to m abscessus m abscessus has emerged as a major pathogen in cf where it is the leading mycobacterial cause of progressive lung disease recent reports suggest the existence of persontoperson spread of m abscessus between cf patients and segregation in cf centres is increasingly recommended m abscessus also causes nodularbronchiectatic disease in patients without cf classically nonsmoking m abscessus is uniformly resistant to standard antituberculous agents and there is currently no proven curative antibiotic regimen for m abscessus lung disease regimens based on in vitro drug susceptibilities are recommended a typical treatment protocol in cf might comprise induction therapy for at least weeks with iv amikacin iv cefoxitin or imipenem and po azithromycin followed by longterm maintenance therapy with nebulized amikacin po azithromycin and another po agent to which the isolate is sensitive eg a quinolone azithromycin appears to induce less macrolide resistance and is probably more effective than clarithromycin against m abscessus tigecycline may be a useful secondline agent for induction although nausea often limits its use although guidelines recommend continuing antibiotic treatment for months once cultures are negative in practice achieving this level of suppression of m abscessus is often unrealistic this is a chronic incurable infection for many cf patients and intermittent courses of iv agents eg amikacin cefoxitin or imipenem are typically required to treat exacerbations and control symptomsminimize progression of lung disease mycobacterium chelonae rarely causes lung disease treat with at least two drugs to which the isolate displays in vitro susceptibility often susceptible to macrolides tobramycin amikacin imipenem resistant to cefoxitin mycobacterium fortuitum often does not cause progressive lung disease in the absence of treatment when therapy is needed usually susceptible to

increases with age infection in transplant recipients results from either transmission from a cmv positive donor to a cmv antibody negative recipient via the organ or a blood transfusion or reactivation of latent cmv in a seropositive recipient as a result of immunosuppression infection occurs most frequently during the first months following organ or bone marrow transplantation corresponding to the period of maximal tcell suppression gvhd increases the risk of cmv infection clinical and laboratory features flulike symptoms in immunocompetent patients symptoms of cmv pneumonia in the immunocompromised are nonspecific fever dry cough dyspnoea and malaise extrapulmonary manifestations of cmv infection eg gastrooesophagitis hepatitis may suggest the diagnosis hypoxia may occur leucopenia thrombocytopenia and abnormal lfts are characteristic imaging cxr typically bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrate although lobar consolidation and localized haziness also described can be normal a nodular infiltrate may suggest coinfection with aspergillus ct features include localized or diffuse groundglass and nodular shadowing that may progress to airspace

immunosuppression where possible ganciclovir mgkg iv bd for weeks side effects include neutropenia anaemia consider additional treatment with anticmv hyperimmune globulin or prolonged oral valganciclovir in cases of severe or relapsed disease foscarnet mgkg tds for weeks is an alternative to ganciclovir for resistant cases but toxicity nephrotoxicity metabolic disturbance can limit treatment complications opportunistic infection eg pcp aspergillosis due to further suppression of tcell function by the cmv infection itself increased risk of organ rejection as allografts are more

typically a history of recent exposure to a contact infected with chickenpox or shingles chest symptoms tend to occur several days after the onset of rash erythematous macules progressing to papules and then vesicles although rarely may precede the rash cough and breathlessness are common and pleuritic pain and haemoptysis may occur cxr typically shows a diffuse small nodular infiltrate hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions may uncommonly occur nodules may subsequently calcify and persist multiorgan involvement may occur diagnosis is usually suspected on the basis of the history of exposure presence of rash and cxr features cytological examination of smears from skin lesions serology or viral culture or pcr on bal fluid may confirm the diagnosis treatment of varicella pneumonia is with early administration of aciclovir mgkg iv tds for days aciclovir is not licensed for use in pregnancy but does not appear to be associated with increased foetal abnormalities and the benefits of treatment almost certainly outweigh any risk varicella is very infectious until lesions enter the crusting stage inpatients should be isolated extracorporeal membrane oxygenationlife support has been used successfully in individuals with fulminant respiratory failure consider early administration of varicellazoster immune globulin for immunocompromised and pregnant patients exposed to varicella most cases resolve spontaneously but a minority progresses to respiratory failure and death mortality may be significantly higher in pregnancy chapter respiratory infectionviral hantavirus pulmonary syndrome also known as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome caused by singlestranded enveloped rna hantaviruses first described following an outbreak in the southwestern usa in several different hantaviruses eg sin nombre virus have been associated with this syndrome previously described hantavirusassociated diseases occurred more commonly in scandinavia and northeastern asia and tended to cause haemorrhagic fever and renal failure with relative sparing of the lung very rare and affected individuals are almost exclusively from america particularly from the four corners region of usa where arizona colorado utah and new mexico meet a outbreak affecting ten people who visited yosemite national park california was thought to be associated with rodent infestation in cabin insulation disease develops following inhalation of aerosolized viruses from rodent faeces urine or saliva and typically affects previously well young adults common presenting symptoms are fever chills cough myalgia and gi symptoms such as vomiting and abdominal pain breathlessness occurs later in the disease course and is often quickly followed by respiratory failure and the development of ards shock may occur and is associated with a poor prognosis laboratory testing classically reveals neutrophilia thrombocytopenia elevated ldh and sometimes renal impairment and mildly abnormal lfts leucocytosis and immunoblasts in peripheral blood are associated with severe disease cxr typically shows initially bilateral basal infiltrates that progress to involve all regions of the lung a minority are normal diagnosis may be confirmed using serology pcr for the virus or by detection of viral antigen using immunochemistry treatment is supportive within an icu including the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation when appropriate it is unclear if persontoperson transmission occurs and patients should be in respiratory isolation iv ribavirin may be administered although this

weeks and then reduce if there has been a response maintenance dose of around mg to control symptoms and prevent progression of disease leave on this dose for a few months and then slowly reduce steroid dose further maintain on low dose of prednisolone mgday or alternate days for prolonged period of up to months to consolidate resolution before considering complete withdrawal remember bone

blood cells sickling when deoxygenated eg in atelectatic lung resulting in chronic haemolysis and vascular occlusion with tissue infarction in indi viduals homozygous for the βglobin gene mutation sickle cell anaemia disease hb electrophoresis or highperformance liquid chromatography hplc in sickle cell disease demonstrates hbs and no normal hb hba anaemia hb gdl is usual heterozygote carriers of the βglobin gene mutation are referred to as having sickle cell trait and are largely asymptomatic although sickle crises may occur during extreme hypoxia eg during anaesthesia hplc analysis

of acute chest syndrome following treatment of vasoocclusive crises with no corticosteroids may be of benefit in reducing length of hospital admission but rebound painful crises are more common and

including pharyngeal dilators some narrowing of the upper airway is normal excessive narrow ing with the onset of sleep is due to the following factors causes of a small pharyngeal size when awake such that normal muscle relaxation with sleep is enough to provoke critical narrowing fatty infiltration of pharyngeal tissues and external pressure from increased neck fat andor muscle bulk large tonsils subtle abnormalities of craniofacial shape eg minor micrognathia or retrognathia extra submucosal tissue eg myxoedema mucopolysaccharidoses upper airway narrowing provoked by sleep causing sufficient sleep frag mentation to result in significant daytime symptoms usually excessive sleepiness obstructive sleep apnoea osa causes of excessive narrowing of the airway occurring with muscle relaxation at sleep onset mass loading from an obese or muscular neck may simply overwhelm residual dilator action as well as reduce the starting size neuromuscular diseases with pharyngeal involvement may lead to greater loss of dilator muscle tone eg stroke myotonic dystrophy duchenne dystrophy mnd muscle relaxants such as sedatives and alcohol increasing age other theories in a small number of examples of osa a heightened tendency to arouse before the breathing and the upper airway stabilize may be important in maintaining ventilatory instability there may also be years of damage to the mucosa from snoring which reduce the protective reflex dilation of the pharynx in response to narrowing activated by surface receptors predisposing conditions osa is found more commonly in certain conditions such as acromegaly and hypothyroidism but the reasons are not well under stood it is unclear whether there need to be any other nonanatomical factors to provoke osa most associated abnormalities that have been described are likely to be to long periods of snoring and osa rather than causal factors shortterm consequences of osa in severe osa repetitive collapse of the upper airway with the arousal required to reactivate the pharyngeal dila tors occurs approximately every minute throughout the sleeping period eventsh or over night they are usually attended by hypoxia see fig and hypercapnia that are corrected during the interapnoeic hyperventilatory period obstructive events short of complete obstruc tion also provoke arousal as it is usually the compensatory reflex increase in inspiratory effort rather than the blood gas deterioration directly that wakens the brain in this situation the drops in o saturation may be very much less and in younger thinner individuals almost imperceptible on oxi metry tracings see fig this is because the compensation afforded by the increased inspiratory effort may be adequate and the bigger o stores in the lungs of the less obese will buffer any brief hypoventilation recurrent arousals lead to highly fragmented and unrefreshing sleep excessive daytime sleepiness results the correlation between the sleep fragmentation and the resultant degree of sleepiness is not tight with some patients being sleepy with low levels of fragmentation and vice versa this is thought to result partly from interindividual differences in sensitivity to the effects of sleep fragmentation with every arousal there is a rise in bp often over mmhg it is unclear if these bp rises do any damage to the cardiovascular system there is also a carryover of hypertension average of mmhg into the waking hours which falls after treatment at month there is true nocturia mechanism unclear there may be raised atrial natriuretic peptide anp levels from increased central blood volume from the subatmospheric intrathoracic pressures during the obstructed breathing or it may be simply a reflection of highly fragmented sleep preventing the normal reduction in urine flow associated with sleep chapter sleep apnoea and hypoventilation osa clinical features chapter covers many of the essential features in the history and dis

with reversal of the usual daynight ratio less often there will be nocturnal sweating reduced libido oesophageal reflux increasingly common are patients arriving with spouses worried by the apnoeic pauses they have observed sleepiness sometimes difficult to assess failure by the patient to recognize the problem or denial due to concerns over driving and licensing the epworth scale see e p assesses tendency to fall asleep rather than perceived sleepiness per se as some patients may regard their situation as normal it is important to separate the symptom of tiredness from sleepiness see e pp the latter being much more typical of osa although sometimes complained of rather than sleepiness more by women with osa examination and investigations the examination often unrewarding and the investigations are detailed in chapter see e pp look for the presence of additional lower airways obstruction with associated co retention socalled overlap syndrome co retention in pure osa is very uncommon except in the very very obese it appears that the additive effect of some lower airways obstruction often not enough in its own right to precipitate co retention is required which perhaps limits the interapnoeic hyperventilation and thus gradually encourages tolerance to raised levels of co the majority of patients with significant osa are tend to have a com bination of upper body obesity neck circumference in and a rela tively undersized or setback mandible airway size can be assessed and documented with scoring systems eg see e p osa clinical features sleep study the sleep study assesses if there is anything likely to be the cause of the patients symptoms the considerable grey area between normality and abnormality means that sometimes it is unclear whether the symptoms can be blamed on the sleep study findings there is also considerable nightto night variation in sleep study indices that further blurs the distinction between normality and abnormality in this

false negatives discussed earlier can occur with younger and thinner patients limited sleep studies respiratory psg are the usual routine investigation different units have expertise in interpreting different sorts of sleep studies experience is more important than the particular sleep study equipment used any system should assess the degree of sleep fragmentation and the degree of upper airway narrowing this can be done using many different direct and indirect techniques management not all patients need treatment the evidence for significant treatment benefits rests on symptoms which drive treatment rather than the degree of osa on a sleep study treatment decisions require a close dialogue between physician and patient recent evidence suggests that many patients underestimate their symptoms so that when in doubt erring on the side of a cpap trial is sensible key features in making a treatment choice how sleepy is the patient does it affect qol is it critical to the patients

sits by the patients bed and is connected to a mask by a length of largebore tubing the masks are usually just nasal but nose and mouth masks are also used the blower raises the pressure at which the patient is breathing to about cmho and splints open the pharynx preventing its collapse sleep fragmentation and the consequent daytime sleepiness cpap is a highly effective therapy with resolution of the sleepiness and large gains in qol it is a sufficiently curi ous and initially uncomfortable therapy to require a careful induction pro gramme without this the takeup and compliance rates are poor most centres have found that a dedicated cpap nurse or technician is required many centres use special patient education aids such as video presenta tions and provide helplines the best method of establishing a patient on cpap and deriving the required mask pressure is not known and many different approaches appear to work recent innovations include cpap machines that automatically hunt for the required pressure and do not require an attended overnight titration new mask designs appear at regu lar intervals with a slow improvement in their comfort and fit important to prevent air leaks patients require access to longterm support to maintain their cpap equipment and attend to problems there are now significant problems supporting the very large numbers of patients on cpap that accu mulate the longer a service has been in operation the commonest problems encountered include mouth leaks lead to increased air through the nose and out of the mouth with excessive drying of the mucosa nasal congestion rhinitis and sneezing usually solved with the addition of a heated humidifier pain and ulceration of the skin on the nasal bridge try different masks or patient interfaces not resting

one is responsible for ones vigilance levels while driving we know when we are sleepy and should stop driving driving while sleepy has been likened to driving whilst drunk and a prison sentence can result from sleeprelated accidents on the road no one should drive while they are sleepy and the same applies to pathological causes of sleepiness advice to all patients with osas or suspected osas whatever the situation do not drive while sleepy stop and have a nap this is common sense regardless of the cause of the sleepiness if the sleepiness is sufficient to impair driving ability patients must stop driving patients with osa syndrome ie osa with daytime hypersomnolence should write to the dvla who will send them a questionnaire sl if they admit to exces sive and inappropriate daytime sleepiness their licence is revoked if already treated and the sleepiness has resolved then the licence is not revoked hence rapid treatment is essential it is the doctors duty to tell the patient of the diagnosis of osas and of the requirement to inform the dvla if there is sleepiness sufficient to impair driving patients who are not sleepy and only have osa on their sleep study do not have osas and thus do not need to inform the dvla although the dvla is inconsistent on this issue according to usa epidemiological studies at least men have osa on a sleep study but at most only a quarter will be sleepy thus if all osa were reported to the dvla this would rather overwhelm the dvla and be illogical the dvla rules change from time to time and reference to the latest version of their website and the at a glance guide is recommended the doctor can advise the patient whether they should stop driving entirely essential if the patient is very sleepy has had a sleepinessrelated accident or near miss andor drives a hgv or public service vehicle class licence holders or to continue driving only with extreme caution for short distances the advice given to the patient should be recorded in the notes the latest american thoracic guidelines are entirely sensible and useful inappropriate and illogical curbing of driving privileges will push the problem underground through fear of loss of

success of the treatment must be verified by a specialist clinic this means a normal ess and evidence of adequate cpap usage from the hour meters built into cpap machines a minimum usage has not been

enlarged tonsils and adenoids varying degrees of osa are present in up to of children around the age of prevalence tails off as tonsils atrophy these children present with snoring restless sleep and different daytime symptoms to those of adults obvious sleepiness is less common sleepdeprived children tend to become hyperactive with reduced attention spans and be labelled as difficult or disruptive or even adhd symptoms will fluctuate with the size of the tonsils and this depends on the presence of upper respiratory infections mild intermittent sleep disturbance may not matter but every night sleep fragmentation for months interferes with development in a variety of ways the clinical decision is mainly whether to recommend removal of tonsils or a waitandsee policy remembering that there is a significant morbidity from adenotonsillectomy and even the occasional death a halfway house is the use of nasal steroids which can reduce tonsillar size sufficiently to improve

occurrence of rem fig overlap syndromeosa and copd low baseline sao some periods with typical sawtoothdipping other periods with prolonged falls in sao chapter sleep apnoea and hypoventilation central sleep apnoea csa and nocturnal hypoventilation definition and epidemiology csahypopnoea or hypoventila tion or periodic breathing are said to occur when there is no evidence of upper airway obstruction as the cause for the episodic reduced ventilation during sleep compared with osa it is much less common csa tends to be used as a term when there are actual apnoeas and referred to as cheynestokes breathing when there is regular symmetrical waxing and waning usually in the context of left heart failure periodic breathing is an alternative and can be used to describe regular fluctuations in breathing with or without actual apnoeas the description nocturnal hypoventilation tends to be used when the hypoventilation and hypoxaemic dips are not particularly periodic in nature however these terms are imprecise and sometimes mixed indiscriminately pathophysiology csa or hypoventilation or periodic breathing can occur in a number of set tings with different aetiologies see also chapter e pp at one end of the spectrum is pure loss of ventilatory drive while at the other is pure reduction in the ability to expand the chest adequately with depend ence on accessory muscles of respiration many clinical presentations are mixtures of these two patients with reduced ventilatory drive eg following brainstem damage can often maintain adequate or near adequate ventilation whilst awake as there is a nonmetabolic awake ventilatory drive equivalent to about or lmin during nonrem sleep this awake drive is lost and venti lation becomes dependent on pao and paco during rem sleep an awakelike drive sometimes returns partially and ventilation can improve again seen in congenital forms of absent drive where rem sleep can tem porarily restore sao levels in patients with impaired mechanical ability to ventilate accessory muscles of respiration become critically supportive eg in many neuromuscular dis orders and obstructiverestrictive respiratory conditions however during nonrem sleep this reflex recruitment of accessory muscles is attenuated and hypoventilation follows during rem sleep the physiological paralysis of all postural muscles rem atonia can remove all compensatory mech anisms leaving only the diaphragm working and may produce profound hypoventilation or apnoea chronic hypoventilation often to poor respiratory function eg as evi denced by co retention in some patients with copd or chest wall restrictive disorders can eventually force resetting of ventilatory control mechanisms this is an acquired blunting of ventilatory drive and leads to sleeprelated changes in ventilation similar to those described in the previ ous paragraphs csa and nocturnal hypoventilation unstable ventilatory control can lead to regular oscillations in ventilation eg as occurs in heart failure and at altitude during rem sleep it is normal to have fluctuations in ventilation sometimes with complete apnoeas sometimes sleep studies can be misinterpreted and apnoeas really of obstructive origin are mistakenly labelled as central for example if inspira tory muscles are very weak their poor efforts during obstructive apnoeas may be missed on the ribcage and abdominal bands used in sleep studies but may be detectable with oesophageal pressure monitoring chapter sleep apnoea and hypoventilation causes and clinical features of csa hypoventilation although there are many different causes only four relatively common clini cal scenarios occur but with overlap absent or reduced ventilatory drive brainstem involvement from strokes tumours syringobulbia surgical dam age postpolio syndrome congenital ondines curseusually presents soon after birth can be later abnormalities of neural crest development due to increased number of alanine repeats in one of the homeobox genesphoxb presents clinically with unexplained ventilatory failure much worse during sleep when the awake drive is lost may be recognized early cyanosis morning confusion ankle oedema may be recognized late loss of consciousness and an emergency admission to icu for ventilation following a chest infection or general anaesthesia lung function is often normal with no evidence of respiratory muscle weakness indicating normal innervation from the voluntary motor system arnoldchiari malformation with brainstem compression can present like this but there is usually involvement of surrounding structures such as the lower cranial motor nuclei supplying the larynx and pharynx with associ ated osa see e p postpolio syndrome is illdefined syndromedecline in function decades after initial illness return of weakness in previously affected areas mechanism unclear late development of ventilatory failure is more likely if inspiratory muscles were affected in the original illness additional scoliosis due to paravertebral muscle involvement in which case vc will be reduced this may be due to premature ageing of the upper and lower motor neu rones due to their overuse this could follow the original destruction of some of the anterior horn cells to the inspiratory muscles and the subse quent reinnervation by surviving neurones which then have to continuously supply more neurones than they were designed for weak or mechanically disadvantaged inspiratory muscles withwithout reduction of awake ventilatory drive neuromuscular inspiratory muscle weakness will produce diurnal ventilatory failure in its own right particularly when the supine vc falls below predicted l these patients will have no apparent neuromuscular or respiratory cause for their hypoventilation but may have a previous history of brainstem stroke or other form of brain damage the congenital form usually pre sents shortly after birth when the amount of rem sleep reduces and is replaced by nonrem causes and clinical features of csahypoventilation with increasing inspiratory muscle weakness other accessory inspira tory muscles are recruited to maintain ventilation when this is lost during nonrem sleep and more so during rem sleep ventilation will fall much more than in normal subjects whilst metabolic ventilatory drive is reason ably preserved this will result in recurrent arousals to rescue the ventila tion and consequent marked sleep disturbance as ventilatory drive becomes progressively blunted following the hypoventilation forced on the system by weak muscles extra sleep hypoventilation from loss of awake drive is tolerated and profound hypoxaemia is observed until there is finally an arousal that recovers the ventilation and sao chest wall restrictive diseases such as scoliosis or postthoracoplasty patients see fig can behave in a similar way with gradual onset of ventilatory failure particularly when vc l the muscles are not weak but operating at severe mechanical disadvantage the same situation occurs in copd when muscles are overloaded and accessory muscles provide important support but this too is reduced with nonrem sleep and lost during rem sleep again any reduction in venti latory drive amplifies the sleeprelated falls in sao chest wall restrictive patients should have an obvious restrictive disorder with reduced vc to l or below increasing degrees of copd will produce increasing degrees of sleep hypoventilation see fig if the awake sao is already low the sleeprelated falls in ventilation will produce dramatic dips in sao copd and osa together overlap syndrome see e p provoke profound nocturnal hypoxic dipping see fig and probably a more rapid progression to diurnal hypoventilation with co retention due to extra blunting of ventilatory drive the diaphragm is the only respiratory muscle working during rem sleep as all other postural muscles are profoundly hypotonic if the diaphragm is paralysed then rem sleep is a particularly vulnerable time as there are no muscles of ventilation left working thus producing particularly profound falls in sao during rem patients with bilateral diaphragm weakness can present early with no obvious weakness elsewhere diaphragm weakness is best detected with the patient supine inspiration particularly on sniffing will provoke a paradoxical indrawing of the abdominal wall the vc will also fall on lying down increasingly with greater degrees of paralysis often a fall in vc with complete diaphragm paralysis the above patients should have a history of a progressive neuromuscular disorder chapter sleep apnoea and hypoventilation in a progressive neuromuscular disorder such as mnd the above patterns will be variable between individuals but will gradually worsen predominant diaphragm weakness as occurs sometimes in mnd spinal muscular atro phy and particularly acid maltase deficiency can lead to ventilatory failure at a time when the patient is still ambulant cheynestokes breathing associated with lvf see fig the raised left atrial pressure in left heart failure increases ventilatory drive through stimulation of j receptors this in addition to ventilatory stim ulation from any hypoxaemia from pulmonary oedema this ventilatory stimulation lowers the awake paco producing a respiratory alkalosis in addition the use of diuretics may produce a mild metabolic alkalosis especially if there is hypokalaemia this extra j receptor ventilatory stimulation appears to reduce at sleep onset this together with the loss of the awake ventilatory drive allows central hypoventilation or apnoea to occur this hypoventilation or apnoea will continue until the paco builds up driving ventilation again or until the hypoxaemia provokes arousal the return of ventilation itself may provoke arousal too the arousal itself then injects the increased wake ventilatory drive reducing the paco again sleep returns and once again the low paco and alkalosis cause hypoventilation or apnoea thus a cycle is maintained that involves a fluctuating sleep state with arous als and usually a fluctuating sao as with osa the patient may be com pletely unaware of these arousals the delayed circulatory time of left heart failure may compound this instability by introducing a time delay between any change in paco in the blood leaving the lungs and its arrival at the carotid body or central chemoreceptors cheynestokes breathing associated with altitude the acute hypoxia following ascent to altitude provokes increased venti lation the degree is variable between individuals and hence the degree of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis varies see e p with sleep onset with a lessening of the hypoxic drive and removal of the awake drive an uncompensated alkalosis will allow hypoventilation and even apnoeasimilar to the situation described previously for cheynestokes breathing again ventilation will restart either when the paco rises to a critical level or the hypoxia provokes arousal sleep is fragmented with com plaints of insomnia but the cause of this is rarely recognized by the sufferer skiing in colorado altitude m ft is high enough to provoke significant periodic breathing in about a fifth of individuals it seems that this fifth are the ones with the highest hypoxic ventilatory response this gives them the largest respiratory alkalosis and hence the greatest ten dency to sleeponset hypoventilation in addition the tendency to arouse with the resultant extra hypoxaemia may be greater too thus provoking large increases in ventilation on arousal and greater sleep disturbance as causes and clinical features of csahypoventilation the kidney excretes extra bicarbonate and produces a compensatory meta bolic acidosis over a few days the periodic breathing lessens see also e pp altitude sickness two pharmacological approaches have been taken to reduce this sleeprelated periodic breathing at altitude preacclimatization with acetazolamide prior to ascent this produces a mild metabolic acidosis and maintains the ventilatory drive at sleep onset thus blocking the hypoventilation rcts show the efficacy of this approach with doses between and mgday days prior to ascent hypnotics such as temazepam can reduce the degree of periodic breathing by reducing the tendency to arousal with each return of ventilation and thus damping the system randomized trials suggest benefit for the early part of the night with no impairment of nocturnal hypoxaemia or daytime functioning of course extra o will abolish the problem chapter sleep apnoea and hypoventilation csahypoventilation investigations simple pfts will characterize weakness of inspiratory muscles supine vc is the best predictor of ventilatory failure as it incorporates diaphragm weakness that is masked during erect testing blood gases will reveal diur nal type ii ventilatory failure if the bicarbonatebase excess is raised with a normal paco showing therefore a mild metabolic alkalosis then this may indicate nocturnal hypoventilation and incipient ventilatory failure the bicarbonate has been referred to as the hbac of paco as it represents an integrated response to the average raised paco over the last h or so in the absence of any other reason for a metabolic alkalosis such as hypokalaemia and some diuretics sleep study for examples see figs and sleep studies in patients with suspected nocturnal hypoventilation or csa confirm the diagnosis and assess the degree of nocturnal hypoxaemia limited sleep studies should reveal falls in sao in association with hypoven tilation but no evidence of osa and in particular no snoring oximetry tracings alone will show a variety of patterns often resembling osa the pattern in neuromuscular weakness will vary from oscillations all the time due to recurrent arousal to just rem sleeprelated dips in sao the same will be true for chest wall restrictive disorders and copd with rem dips occurring initially and greater hypoxaemia once there is an element of diur nal co retention and hypoxaemia in osa there is a slow fall in sao as o levels fall in the lung followed by a rapid rise with the first deep inspiration as the apnoea ends socalled sawtooth pattern see fig in cheynestokes of left heart failure the oscillations in sao are often more sinusoidal than in osa as the pattern of breathing is usually more of a symmetrical waxing and waning of ventilation see fig however if each central apnoea is terminated by an arousal rather than a smooth return of ventilation then the pattern will look more like osa in copd the degree of hypoxaemia on the sleep study will depend very much on the awake sao because of the shape of the hb dissociation curve a low awake sao makes it easier for the sao to fall further with a given reduction in ventilation thus during nonrem with removal of awake drive there will be a fairly stable reduction in sao but during rem sleep there will be further more dramatic dips it is important not to diag nose osa from just an oximetry tracing on the basis of sao oscillations when there is a low baseline sao and copd in this situation a fuller sleep study is required to provide evidence of additional upper airway obstruc tion the combination of hypoxic copd and osa one of the overlap syndromes can produce particularly dramatic traces see fig management intervention in csa or hypoventilation or periodic breathing depends on symptoms better control of heart failure may improve cheynestokes breathing but often does not further treatment will be required for two reasons either to prevent the cyclical breathing and csahypoventilation investigations restore sleep quality or to globally improve ventilation overnight and reset the respiratory control mechanisms such that the daytime respiratory fail ure reverses in situations where the hypoxia is playing a part in the pathogenesis eg heart failure then raising fio can help using o via nasal prongs only during sleep there is limited literature on other forms of treatment for the cheynestokes of heart failure although acetazolamide and benzodi azepines have been tried the unstable breathing in heart failure has been treated with cpap however a large rct has not confirmed longterm benefit more recently treatment has been tried with sophisticated servoventilators that are able to cut in smoothly as ventilation wanes and backs off when it waxes thus ironing out the oscillations without overventilating whether these will provide better relief of symptoms than o is not yet clear but preliminary evidence suggests they might there are some data to suggest that the recurrent arousal in cheynesstokes may raise catecholamine lev els and provoke deterioration of lv function thus measures to reduce the arousals may improve cardiac function as well as improve daytime vigilance sedatives are contraindicated with a raised paco and extra o may increase the hypercapnia in these situations then overnight niv via either nose or face mask may be appropriate in slowly progressive neuromus cular disorders with either sleep fragmentation or diurnal type ii respira tory failure or both the symptomatic and physiological response can be dramatic the use of niv at night in more rapidly progressive disorders has potential difficulties but is proving very useful in the palliative care of disor ders such as mnd increasing dependence on equipment not designed to be immediately lifesustaining is a particular issue in scoliosis there is rarely any question that treatment might not be appropriate and again responses are dramatic future developments treatment of lvf acute and chronic no evidence yet for the latter with overnight cpap or niv introduction of overnight ventilation earlier in the course of a progressive neuromuscular disorder such as mnd to reduce symptoms and possibly prolong life use of overnight ventilation on patients with stable copd and hypercapnia this may reduce exacerbations hospital admissions and prolong life the evidence is inadequate yet to justify its wide use in this patient group further information oldenburg o

accumulation of numerous and diffuse calcified microliths round calcium and phosphate hydroxyapatite bodies in the alveolar space there is no identifiable abnormality of cal cium metabolism a mutation in the slca gene that encodes a type iib sodiumphosphate cotransporter in alveolar type ii cells resulting in the accumulation and formation of microliths rich in calcium phosphate due to impaired clearance is considered to be the cause of the disease microliths are occasionally identified in the sputum at postmortem the lungs are heavy and rock hard often needing a saw to cut them fewer than

pathophysiology and classification definition amyloidosis is the extracellular deposition of low molecular weight protein molecules as insoluble fibrils more than such proteins have been described in different diseases and circumstances for classifica tion see box pathophysiology the disease is one of abnormal protein folding and is classified by the origin of the precursor proteins that form the amyloid for example al amyloid forms from the light chains of immunoglobulins in familial forms genetic missense mutations produce abnormal folding of the protein little is known of the specific genetic and environmental fac tors that lead to the development of this abnormal folding despite their different origins these protein molecules fold into alternative forms that are very similar to each other in the classic βpleated sheet structure fibrils form in an ordered fashion with uniformity of fibril structure within the sheet substitutions of particular amino acids at specific positions in the light chain variable region lead to destabilization of the light chains increas ing the chance of fibrillogenesis in certain models this abnormal folding can be initiated by the addition of amyloidenhancing factor rather like the ini tiation of crystal formation in a supersaturated solution amyloid deposits accumulate in the extracellular space disrupting normal tissue architecture and leading to organ dysfunction both directly and having spaceoccupying effects the fibrils may be directly cytotoxic possibly by promoting apop tosis the subdivisions of amyloid are largely based on the origin of the amyloid protein and shown in box epidemiology the epidemiology is difficult to define accurately as the disease is often un or misdiagnosed the ageadjusted incidence is esti mated to be per million person years future developments antiamyloid drugs are under investigation including drugs to stabilize the amyloid precursor proteins in their normal configuration and enhance fibril degradation amyloidosis pathophysiology and classification box classification of amyloidosis light chain amyloid al from immunoglobulin light chain fragments λ or κ usually monoclonal due to a plasma cell dyscrasia a subtype of lymphoproliferative disorders in deaths due to this type of amyloid median survival is months frank myeloma is present in and a subtle monoclonal gammopathy in mgus

diameter from to cm they may cavitate or calcify clinical signs are nondiagnostic pfts may show a restrictive defect with reduced transfer factor the differential diagnosis usually includes fibrosis cardiac amyloid may coexist and distin guishing the contribution to the symptoms of the pulmonary and cardiac disease can be difficult median survival with clinically overt lung disease is about

on electron microscopy the langerhans cells seen in lch appear to be monoclonal although it is unclear if this represents a true neoplastic process the antigen stimulus for activating langerhans cells in the lung is unknown although cigarette smoke is a pos sible candidate langerhans cells are typically organized into granulomata that are located in bronchiolar walls and subsequently enlarge and invade adjacent structures this results in the radiological appearance of nodules that at first cavitate and then become cystic clinical features typically exertional breathlessness and cough some

diseases pulmonary alveolar proteinosis pap pathophysiology and clinical features pap also referred to as alveolar lipoproteinosis is a rare alveolar filling defect affecting around per million people there is a limited published literature five reported case series of cases and only total cases reported pathophysiology pap is due to failure of alveolar macrophages to clear spent surfactant leading to the filling of alveoli with a phospholipid proteinaceous material it is thought that the defect has an autoimmune basis and in the idiopathic form is due to the presence of antibodies to granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsf which cause inhibition of normal alveolar macrophage function leading to abnormalities of surfactant homeostasis defects in gmcsf signalling have been identi fied in animal models congenital disease is thought to be due to mutations in surfactant gene proteins other mechanisms for surfactant accumulation have also been identified heavy dust exposure leads to surfactant hypersecretion which exceeds the lungs normal clearance mechanism animal models have shown that this condition develops from endogenous lipoid pneumonia with the accumulation of lipidladen macrophages which break down to release surfactant amphiphilic drugs eg amiodarone chlorphentermine lymphoma leukaemia and immunosuppression the mechanism is uncertain but it is thought that the lipoprotein may be generated from degenerating alveolar cells appearances similar to alveolar lipoproteinosis may also be seen in endog enous lipoid pneumonia resulting from bronchial obstruction and are described in surfactantsecreting alveolar cell carcinoma histology the alveoli are filled with a granular acellular eosinophilic pas periodic acidschiffpositive deposit

arterial and systemic venous circulations they vary in size from tiny clusters of vessels telangiectasia to larger more complex aneurysmaltype sacs the disorder is rare affecting in several genetic susceptibility loci have been identified on chr and chr one identified mutation is in the endoglin gene this modulates signalling via the tgfβ family of growth factors this gene is also implicated in the development of pph subjects with significant pavms have low pulmonary vascular resistance a low mean pap and a high cardiac outputdue to longstanding adaptive mechanisms to the effects of the shunt in addition to vascular remodelling effects most patients present postpuberty as avms probably develop at this time they probably grow throughout life especially during puberty and in pregnancy they may rarely regress spontaneously diagnosis most patients present with an abnormal cxr classically showing a smooth rounded intrapulmonary mass with draining or feeding vessels mild hypoxaemia an avm is a direct communication between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein blood therefore bypasses the pulmonary capillary bed with reduced oxygenation which poorly corrects with supplementary o orthodeoxia is desaturation on standing due to an increase in blood flow in the dependent lung areas of pavms are basal hence the desaturation seen ct identifies all avms and can determine those suitable for embolization contrast is not required patients may present with the complications of a pavm particularly bleeding or peripheral abscess formation the absence of a normal filtering

respiratory physicians are often involved in making difficult decisions about the appropriateness of treatment and the prolongation of life in patients with chronic underlying lung disease some common clinical scenarios encountered are discussed here sometimes artificial ventilation may pro long the dying process life has a natural end and the potential to prolong life in the icu can sometimes cause dilemmas in other cases these inter ventions are valuable at prolonging life with a reversible complication the general medical council gmc states that doctors have an obligation to respect human life protect the health of their patients and put their patients best interests first this means offering treatments where the benefits outweigh any risks and avoiding treatments that carry no net gain to the patient if a patient wishes to have a treatment that in the doctors considered view is not indicated the doctor and medical team are under no ethical or legal obligation to provide it but the patients right to a second opinion must be respected discussions about resuscitation and invasive ventilation are rarely easy but should ideally be held with the patient their next of kin and nursing staff in advance of an emergency situation clearly this is not always possi ble ideally all decisions regarding resuscitation and the ceiling of treatment particularly relating to ventilation should be documented in advance and handed over to oncall teams most possible outcomes can be anticipated where it has been decided that a treatment is not in the best interests of the patient there is no ethical distinction between stopping the treatment or not starting it in the first place though the former may be more difficult to do and this should not be used as an argument for failing to initiate the treatment in the first place lasting power of attorney lpa allows an appointed attorney to make decisions about personal welfare including giving or refusing consent to treatment if the patient loses their capacity as defined by the mental capacity act neither the next of kin nor those with lpa have the legal right to determine any treatment the responsibility remains with the doctor and mdt occasionally involving the courts of law advance decisions also known as living wills and formerly advance directives are statements documenting what treatment the individual would want in the future or would want to refuse in specific circumstances should they lack capacity they are legally binding in england and wales and doctors giving treatment against the patients wishes expressed in a directive could be prosecuted in scotland and northern ireland advance decisions are gov erned by common law rather than legislation if there are concerns about the validity of the document doctors should seek input from senior colleagues or the hospital medical director advance decisions do not have to be written down signed and witnessed unless they include decisions about resuscita tion and other potential lifeprolonging treatments the patient must under stand the implications of hisher decision although if they have capacity their word can override their advance directive or their legal representative advance statements are written by the patient about their prefer ences wishes beliefs and values but are not legally binding they provide a guide for others to make decisions in the patients best interests if they lose capacity in the future copd copd copd is the th commonest cause of death in america and most patients die of respiratory failure during an exacerbation a commonly encountered clinical situation is where a patient with copd is admitted with an exacerba tion and is in type ii respiratory failure standard treatment does not improve the respiratory acidosis so niv is commenced before starting niv a deci sion must be clearly documented as to whether or not niv is the ceiling of treatment it may be especially if the patient has severe or endstage copd invasive ventilation in the icu may be appropriate in certain specific situ ations for example in a relatively young patient ie y a patient with a relatively new diagnosis of copd in whom the episode is the first or second admission in the patient in whom there is a very obviously potentially reversible cause for the exacerbation eg pneumonia sometimes in this situation a defined time period for intensive care input may be decided eg ventilation for h to allow treatments to work and to allow time to assess for any improvement with extubation after that time period if no improvement has been made decisions about intubationventilation and intensive care admission can only be made knowing the patients usual level of functioning and previous qol the difficulty is that qol is a very subjective measure objective meas ures of usual functioning eg measures of daily activity usual exercise tol erance and whether home care or assistance with activities of daily living is required are often more useful in guiding the appropriateness of escalating therapy with reference to the patient with copd the number of hospital admissions and exacerbations and the need for home o or nebulizers will also be useful helpful information may be obtained from the gp especially if the previous hospital notes are unavailable where limited information is available about the patient and therefore uncertainty exists about the appropriateness of ventilation it should be started until a clearer assessment can be made this may be relevant for a patient attending the emergency department where little information is available the above point concerning the withdrawal of therapy should it subsequently be found to be inappropriate also holds there are downsides to invasive ventilation the risk of pneumotho rax is increased in those with endstage emphysema and the risk of vap increases with time ventilated see e p knowledge of the risk of these adverse events helps the medical team to balance the argument and make a decision about whether the risks of ventilation are likely to outweigh its benefits the issue of limited resources should not influence a decision about formal ventilation or icu admission the average length of intubation of patients with copd admitted to icu is days these patients have a inhospital mortality with of patients surviving y posticu discharge about will be living inde pendently y posthospital discharge clearly only a very selected subgroup of patients are admitted to icu but concerns about prolonged periods of ventilation in this group of patients seem to be unfounded patients in whom a clear cause for the exacerbation can be identified eg pneumonia tend to do better as there is a treatable cause for the exacerbation and not just progression of the underlying disease chapter ethical issues lung cancer and neurological disease lung cancer the use of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia in a patient with advanced lung malignancy may be inappropriate in some cir cumstances the patients wishes and qol stage and extent of disease response to other treatments eg chemotherapy are all paramount this is another situation in which it might be appropriate to define at the outset the treatments that are appropriate eg days total of iv and oral antibi otics note that treatments such as antibiotics can lead to improvement in symptoms eg by reducing fever without necessarily prolonging life and it may be kinder to continue antibiotics in this situation progressive neurological disease the decision about niv in a patient with a progressive neuromuscular disease can be difficult there is now strong rct evidence that niv in patients with some neuromuscular diseases duchenne muscular dystrophy mnd neuromuscular and chest wall disease improves qol and survival decisions about the requirement and timing of niv need to be made by specialists in neuromuscular disease in conjunction with home ventilation teams clinical deterioration can usu ally be anticipated with serial measurements of spirometry and overnight o or co discussions should take place early on unless the patient pre sents in respiratory failure eg due to pneumonia and subsequent ventila tor weaning is difficult clinicians patients and their relatives may differ in their approaches to niv in the face of progressive neuromuscular disability but of all the palliative options available niv can be particularly useful further decisions about withdrawal of treatment with progression of the underlying neurological disease of course will still be needed these can be difficult and require multidisciplinary input actual practical niv withdrawal can also be hard requiring specialist assistance but it usually done gradually with sedation cover

inhaler devices that deliver drugs directly to the airways but essentially two basic types mdis and dry powder inhalers dpis new devices are being introduced all the time with one or two or even three drugs delivered simultaneously check what is available through your local formulary see table ideally patients should try a range of devices to choose the most appropriate for them patients should receive advice and a demonstration on inhaler technique and use see table technique should be checked regularly and if patients cannot manage a particular device they should be switched to another many pharmacists have been trained to assess inhaler technique the percentage of a drug delivered to the airway varies for each device from to according to the manufacturers and depends on good technique spacer devices improve the delivery with mdis and are particularly useful for the elderly children and those who find it difficult to coordinate inhaler administration with breathing they reduce unwanted oropharyngeal deposition of steroids try to use the same type of inhaler device for all the drug classes used by a patient advise the patient how to recognize when a device is empty some have dose counters others are shaken to hear if they still have contents titrate inhaler doses with clinical response using the minimum possible inhaled steroids do have side effects and the dose

terminology ventilatory support may be invasive via endotracheal tube or tracheos tomy or noninvasive via nasal mask or face mask niv may be subdivided into positive or negative pressure ventilation rarely used now positive pressure ventilators also called niv bilevel bipap trade name deliver volume or pressure support many different types are avail able bilevel pressure support devices are used extensively and provide ventilation with a higher inspiratory positive airway pressure than expira tory pressure ipap and epap the difference in pressure between the two is also called pressure support selected by the prescriber they function in several modes but usually patienttriggered inspiratory support with provision of an underlying backup rate that will cut in if the patient fails to breathe noninvasive positive pressure support may be provided by spe cialized portable ventilators or by standard critical care ventilators new intelligent noninvasive ventilators are becoming available that adjust the ventilation on a breathtobreath basis servoventilators adaptive servoventilation asv for cheynestokes breathing learn this ventilation pattern and can increase the pressure support during the hypoventilation phase and decrease it during the hyperventilation phase effectively ironing out the oscillations without leading to overventilation and hypocapnia volumeassured pressure support ventilation vapsv is where tidal volumes and minute ventilation are monitored and the inspira tory pressure is adjusted to maintain the previous learned ventilation the role of these new ventilators is still being assessed and they may only be appropriate for certain clinical situations negative pressure ventilators assist inspiration by sucking out the chest wall expiration occurs through elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall includes devices such as tank ventilators and chest cuirasse or shell ventilators the hayek oscillator is a highfrequency version of the negative pressure cuirasse ventilator other devices such as the rocking bed and pneumobelt displace abdominal contents to aid diaphragmatic contrac tion used extensively in the polio epidemics of the s they are now only very rarely used to manage chronic respiratory failure cpap supplies constant positive pressure during inspiration and expira tion and is therefore not a form of ventilation but is sometimes mistakenly referred to as such it provides a splint to open the upper airway and col lapsed alveoli thus improving vq matching cpap is used extensively in the community to treat osa but also has a role in improving oxygenation in selected patients with acute respiratory failure eg patients with cardio genic pulmonary oedema pneumocystis pneumonia see e pp and the obese see e pp

its compli cations eg upper airway trauma vap alternatively niv may represent the ceiling of treatment in patients deemed unsuitable for intubation niv is not an alternative to invasive ventilation in patients who require this defini tive treatment as it is not sufficiently secure acute exacerbation of copd consider niv in patients with an acute exacerbation of copd who have a respiratory acidosis ph despite initial medical treatment and controlled o therapy still often required to rescue patients who have been given too high a concentration of o to breath reduced hypoxic drive and have become hypercapnic and acidotic response to niv can be rapid benefits include reduced mortality and need for intubation more rapid improvement in physiological outcomes rr ph and symptomatic relief from breathlessness when compared with standard medical treatment niv only assists ventilation the pressures used are not enough to take over ventilation due to the high airways resistance invasive ventilation if deemed appropriate should be considered particularly in patients with a severe respiratory acidosis ph as this is associated with treatment failure and increased mortality with niv alone high expiratory pressures eg cmho peep may help reduce the work of breathing by offsetting intrinsic peep but will lessen the ipapepap difference thus reducing the ventilation component unless inspiratory pressures are further increased acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema use of cpap via face mask is effective and should be considered in patients who fail to improve with medical management alone bilevel niv has not been shown to be superior to cpap and there is a suggestion of increased mi rates following its use it may however have a role in patients who do not respond to cpap decompensated osa niv is effective in the treatment of osa and the overlap syndrome ie raised paco typically with associated obesity hypoventilation or copd see e pp when cpap alone fails to reverse the co retention niv is generally recommended as the first choice over cpap when an acute respiratory acidosis is present but conversion to cpap later may be pos sible when the ventilatory failure has been reversed indications respiratory failure from neuromuscular weakness niv is the treatment of choice for ventilatory failure resulting from neuromuscular weakness or chest wall deformity the pressures used may be adequate to fully take over ventilation because the chest and lung compliance are often little impaired immunocompromised patients immunocompromised patients who develop acute respiratory failure have an extremely high mortality following endotracheal intubation and ventilation in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates fever and hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure intermittent niv results in lower intubation rates and hospital mortality when compared with standard treatment cpap is effective in the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia cap use of niv may result in a reduction in need for intubation compared with standard medical treatment although no significant differences in hospital mortality or length of hospitalization have been shown cpap may have a role in improving oxygenation in severe pneumonia in patients who would potentially be candidates for intubation use of niv or cpap should not inappropriately delay invasive ventilation and so should only be attempted in an icu setting other conditions there is no evidence to support use of niv in acute severe asthma and it should not be used if ventilation is required then it should be invasive no strong evidence to support use of niv in exacerbations of bronchiectasis or cf niv often used improving symptoms and may be useful as a ceiling of treatment in patients with severe underlying disease who would not be considered candidates for invasive ventilation bilevel niv or cpap may have a role in improving gas exchange following trauma or surgery niv is being increasingly used to aid weaning after invasive ventilation chapter noninvasive ventilation contraindications contraindications some relative to the use of niv should be considered in the context of individual patients eg severe hypoxaemia may not be considered a contraindication for niv in a patient who is unsuitable for invasive ventilation contraindications to niv cardiac or respiratory arrest impaired

contraindications chapter noninvasive ventilation niv in acute respiratory failure practical use the decision to start niv should follow a period of initial standard medical treatment including appropriate supplementary and controlled o therapy a proportion of patients will improve and will no longer require ventilation prior to commencing niv a senior doctor should make a decision with the patient and their family regarding suitability for invasive ventilation should niv fail and document this clearly in the medical notes if the patient is a candidate for invasive ventilation care must be taken to avoid inappropriate delays in intubation through the use of niv or cpap liaise with icu staff early setting up niv select an appropriate mask type and size for the patient masks may be nasal or oronasal full face nasal masks require clear nasal passages but often allow mouth leaks particularly in the acutely breathless patient but may be more comfortable fullface masks avoid mouth leakage and are now generally favoured for ventilatory failure allow the patient to hold the mask to their face prior to attaching the head strapsthis may increase confidence and compliance mask adjustments are often necessary to minimize air leaks although some leakage may have to be accepted avoid excessive strap tension one or two fingers should be able to fit under the strap set up the ventilator typical initial pressures for ventilating a patient with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of copd would be epap cmho and ipap cmho with a backup rate of min and inspiratoryexpiratory ratio of in spontaneoustimed mode increase the ipap in increments of cmho to a maximum of as tolerated by the patient similar settings can be used for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure resulting from neuromuscular weakness increase the epap eg to or cm in obese patients with an overlap syndrome of copd and osa to maintain airway patency during inspiration to allow triggering pressure support ventilators can also be set to provide cpap by equal izing the ipap and epap typical pressures range from to cmho cpap may improve oxygenation in selected patients with cardiogenic pul monary oedema or pneumonia supplementary o concentration fio should be guided by the underlying disease process and by oximetry monitoring for many hypercapnic patients with copd aiming for o saturations between and effectively balances the risks of hypoxia vs hypercapnic respiratory acidosis by adding o you are potentially masking gradual ventilation failure by deceptively achieving adequate oxygenation and thus hypercapnia hence more careful blood gas monitoring will be required if at all possible use no or very little added o patient monitoring should involve assessment of comfort rr synchrony with the ventilator mask leaks pulse rate bp and o saturations arterial or capillary blood gas analysis should be performed after no more than h and again after within an hour if there has been no improvement improvement in acidosis and decline in rr after and h niv in acute respiratory failure practical use of treatment are associated with a better outcome repeat the blood gas analysis if the clinical condition changes lack of response may be indicated by a worsening acidosis or persistently abnormal abgs or by a reduced conscious level and clinical deterioration consider invasive ventilation if appropriate the decision to halt niv depends on the circumstances of the individual patient and should be made by a senior doctor subsequent management depends on the patients response optimal duration of niv is unclear but it is typically administered for about days in acute respiratory failure niv does not need to be continuous the patient may have breaks for meals and nebulizers weaning should be gradual and achieved by increasing the period off niv with nocturnal use withdrawn last there is no substitute for personally assessing the efficacy of niv see table for example failure to see the lungs inflating can be due to head position best head position is the socalled sniffing the morning air position produces least pharyngeal resistance leaks can be heard adjustments can be made immediately observe the effect sometimes the presence of intrin sic peep means significant inspiratory effort is being made visible intercostal movement before the ventilator senses inspiration and triggers thus increasing work of breathing this can be seen and the epap gradually raised until there is no delay between patient inspiratory effort and the triggering of the ventilator table troubleshooting problem possible solution clinical deterioration or worsening respiratory failure ensure optimal medical therapy consider complications eg pneumothorax aspiration sputum retention does the patient require intubation if appropriate pco remains high persistent respiratory acidosis exclude inappropriately high fio producing sao check mask and circuit for leaks check for patientventilator asynchrony check expiration valve or blow off is patent consider increasing ipap po remains low kpa with pco ok consider increasing fio consider increasing epap irritation or ulceration adjust strap tension of nasal bridge try cushion dressing change mask type dry nose or mouth consider humidifier check for leaks dry sore eyes check mask fit nasal congestion decongestants eg xylometazoline hypotension reduce ipap or epap if already high chapter noninvasive ventilation niv in chronic respiratory failure chest wall deformity and neuromuscular weakness see e pp niv has a wellestablished role in the management of chronic respiratory failure due to chest wall deformity or neuromuscular weakness and has been shown to improve symptoms gas exchange and mortality common underlying diagnoses include chest wall deformity and scoliosis postpolio syndrome mnd spinal cord injury neuropathies myopathies and muscular dystrophies the nature of the underlying disease must influence the appropriateness of initiating ventilation progressive conditions such as mnd often result in increasing dependence on the ventilator and the patient and their caregivers should be made aware of this niv is administered at home overnight and this improves daytime gas exchange the mechanism for this is unclear it probably resets the central respiratory drive although respiratory muscle rest and improved chest wall and lung compliance may also play a part small portable positive pressure ventilators with either face usual or nasal less often masks are used in the majority of cases negative pressure or abdominal ventilators rarely have a role these days and their use may be limited by upper airways obstruction the decision to introduce overnight niv is difficult and is based on both symptoms morning headaches hypersomnolence fatigue poor sleep quality and evidence of ventilatory failure daytime hypercapnia pco kpa andor base excess andor nocturnal hypoventilation with o saturations on overnight oximetry daytime ventilatory failure however is often a late feature and is typically preceded by hypoventilation during sleep a study in patients with myopathies demonstrated supine inspiratory vc more sensitive to any diaphragm weakness than sitting or standing to be an accurate predictor of respiratory reserve supine inspiratory vc predicted was significantly associated with hypercapnic hypoventilation and such patients should be considered for treatment with niv supine inspiratory vc was typically associated with daytime respiratory failure whereas supine inspiratory vc indicated a minimal risk of respiratory complications other factors include signs of cor pulmonale or hospital admission with respiratory failure patients with excessive secretions may not be suitable for niv although face mask ventilation is possible even in the setting of bulbar weakness regular followup of patients on overnight ventilation is important ask about symptoms and compliance and repeat arterial or capillary blood gas analysis if indicated lack of improvement in gas exchange may reflect noncompliance excessive air leakage inadequate pressure support or progression of underlying disease consider repeating nocturnal oximetry monitoring on the niv patients with persisting niv in chronic respiratory failure severe hypoxia may benefit from longterm supplementary o although this may worsen co retention there are significant issues of risk management when prescribing home niv particularly rapid access to replacement ventilators battery backup facilities careful reassessment when there is evidence of a deterioration and appropriate training of both the patient and their carers sleep apnoea see e pp overnight niv can have a role in patients with central hypoventila tion opiateinduced central apnoea cheynestokes respiration obesity hypoventilation overlap syndromes of osa with coexisting copd or obe sity there is the prospect of further developments in smart ventilators beyond asv and vapsv where not only is the pressure support monitored and adjusted but the level of epap required to hold open the pharynx is also adjusted additional forced oscillation is superimposed on the airflow from the ventilator and the resultant pressure oscillations enable obstruc tive episodes both apnoeas and hypopnoeas to be distinguished central events thus appropriate inspiratory and expiratory pressures are auto matically selected it is not clear if these new devices work consistently across all aetiologies cf see e p overnight niv may have a useful role as a bridge to transplantation in patients with cf and chronic respiratory failure copd see e pp use of niv in the management of chronic stable copd is controver sial trials have shown conflicting results although there is some possible benefit in a subgroup of patients with severe hypercapnia extra nocturnal hypoventilation and recurrent admissions for worsening ventilatory failure a recent rct suggested no overall benefit but may have used suboptimal pressures and interfaces further rcts in this area are ongoing and the use of the new smart ventilator technology may improve the success rate further information elliott mw domiciliary noninvasive ventilation in stable copd thorax ragette r et al patterns and predictors of

and sao values between and are thought best use when extra o is required to raise the sao and where there are no concerns that high pao values will depress ventilatory drive to the point that paco will rise and ph fall dangerously eg pneumonia asthma acute heart failure pe controlled use when extra o is required but ventilation critically depends on hypoxic drive bts recommends eg exacerbations of copd particularly when there has been a chronically raised paco as evidenced by a significant base excess exacerbations of cf exacerbations of ventilatory failure due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome exacerbations of chronic ventilatory failure due to scoliosis neuromuscular disease and any other cause of pump failure with stable type ii ventilatory failure ventilation still seems to be domi nantly driven by pacoph but in exacerbations when pao usually falls peripheral chemoreceptor drive from low pao becomes dominant thus o therapy must not raise pao above kpa sao as this will turn off ventilatory drive allowing hypoventilation hypercapnia acidosis and potentially death there is some evidence that high alveolar po also turns off hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction this allows an increase in pul monary blood flow to poorly ventilated areas and reduces co excretion accounts for of the paco rise following excessive fio in copd exacerbations there is increasing evidence that indiscriminate use of o in some medi cal emergencies may actually be harmful and should only be used if the patient is hypoxaemic and then to achieve no higher than eg ischaemic heart disease including mi postcardiac arrest once stable sickle cell crisis obstetric emergencies most poisonings other than co or cyanide metabolic or renal acidosis with sob emergency o therapy high o levels can be toxic through release of free radicals and this may be the mechanism of damage in some of the above situations following lung injury particularly from paraquat and bleomycin high o concentrations are clearly damaging to the lung thus a degree of controlled hypoxia may be preferable delivering uncontrolled o this can be done in many ways essentially by blowing o over the face whilst limiting inhalation of surrounding air or exhaled co standard o face masks sometimes called highflow masks set the o regulator to at least lmin much more if very breathless to prevent dilution by air drawn into mask by high inspiratory flows via exit holes can deliver about o nasal cannulaeprongscatheters are uncontrolled and deliver unpredictable levels of o depending on flow rate minute ventilation and oral vs nasal breathing titrate using an o saturation monitor nonrebreathe reservoir masks can deliver fio values over by means of a soft plastic bag between the end of the tubing and mask plus oneway valves between the bag and mask and on the mask exit ports this mechanism ensures that most of the inspired air is pure o the ability of the reservoir to empty on inspiration briefly allows higher inspiratory flows than the actual o regulator setting and the bag valve prevents inhalation of very much exhaled co the mask exit valves close preventing air inhalation the usual problem is kinking of the junction between the mask and bag when the head tilts forward reducing the effectiveness of the reservoir very high fio requires a tight seal and is generally delivered with cpap masks using pressures of about cmho this ensures no air is entrained through blowoff vents or leaks as well as improving vq matching by recruiting collapsed alveoli delivering controlled o therapy this requires the ability to reliably control the fio in order to keep the patients sao some prefer but high enough to prevent anaerobic metabolism this lower acceptable level is debatable is generous is likely to be adequate and may be acceptable if cardiac output is adequate and patients usual levels are around this figure fio is controlled through venturi maskso is directed through a narrow nozzle and exits at speed lowering the air pressure at this point this draws in surrounding air diluting the o a proper venturi mask mixes o and air in the same proportion regardless of the o flow the minimum flow setting of the regulator written on the nozzle ensures adequate overall flow to prevent diluting air being drawn through the exit holes during inhalation eg a ventimask has a entrainment ratiolmin o entrains lmin air total flow l min lmin o entrains lmin total flow lmin etc chapter oxygen therapy nasal cannulae are definitely not controlled o therapy and are in fact the opposite if nasal cannulae do deliver too high an fio and ventilation decreases as a consequence the proportion of the minute ventilation containing the fixed flow nasal o will rise increasing the fio and hence pao still furthera vicious cycle controlled o via low flows is also needed sometimes with niv but rarely requires lmin to be entrained again it should be titrated using the sao when the patient on niv is still required to trigger inspiration again added o should be kept to a minimum so as not do depress ventilatory drive when adding too much o it is easy to be lulled into a false sense of security by an sao value while the paco gradually rises undetected o alert card should be given to all patients with a previous episode of hypercapnic respiratory failure see fig this alerts ambulance crews

therapy home o therapy home o therapy was originally prescribed under three clear head ings longterm ltot treatment of chronic hypoxia in copd requiring hday with the evidence base from two randomized trials shortburst o sbot to cover periods of sob such as after exercise and ambulatory to allow activity with less dyspnoea the distinctions became blurred and shortterm use of o for transient sob was shown in most cases to be of little more value than a fan the value of ltot beyond copd has been extended into other causes of hypoxia without very much evidence of benefit and ambulatory o is now more available with increasing usage the bts standards of care subcommittee have recently produced useful advice on o services see further information e p ltot background and indications two landmark trials of ltot in the sthe british mrc working party trial and the american nocturnal o therapy trial nott established the value of ltot the mrc trial compared copd patients receiving o for hday with controls receiving no o the nott trial compared con tinuous daily o average hday with overnight o average h the patients in the mrc trial were on average hypercapnic mean paco kpa whereas those in the nott trial were on average normocapnic mean paco kpa the main outcome in both trials was improved survival in those patients receiving o for at least hday though this improved survival was not seen in the mrc trial until after a year of o therapy the nott trial showed a reduced exercise pap after months of con tinuous or nocturnal o therapy the y survival was related to the fall in mean pap during the first months of continuous o use the mrc trial failed to show a fall in mean pap with ltot but the mean annual increase in pap mmhg in patients in the control arm was not seen in the o treated group the reason for the improved survival with ltot is not clear and is unlikely to relate to the small changes in pulmonary haemodynamics seen copd is the disease for which ltot is most commonly prescribed and the disease in which the original studies were completed subsequent o studies have shown improved exercise endurance in copd patients breath ing supplemental o with improved walking distance and ability to perform daily activities fev is the strongest predictor of survival in copd ltot does not influence the decline in fev additional benefits of ltot include reduction of polycythaemia improved sleep quality by reducing hypoxiaassociated brain arousals reduced cardiac arrthymias and potentially reducing the risk of nocturnal sudden death reduced sympathetic outflow leading to improved renal function with increased salt and water excretion and reduced peripheral oedema indications for ltot ltot is the provision of o therapy to patients with a chronically low pao kpa or mmhg or sao for h a day to include the night when usually most hypoxic with the aim of achieving an awake pao kpa or mmhg or sao paco levels can be normal or raised the indications to which ltot now covers are copd severe chronic asthma ld cf bronchiectasis pulmonary vascular disease pph pulmonary malignancy chronic heart failure ltot can also be prescribed if the pao is between and kpa

the patient remains sufficiently hypoxic to merit ltot blood gases are also taken after min on supplemental o to ensure the target pao has been reached given the daytoday fluctuation in blood gases and the relatively arbitrary nature of the cutoffs for qualifying for ltot it is very likely that oximetry would be equally precise or imprecise as arterial pao however this is not currently recommended home o therapy chapter oxygen therapy arterial gases rather than oximetry may still be preferable when co retention is a possibility but this can occur overnight follwing ltot and not be evident during a min test thus patients need to be warned about the symptoms of co retention and told to reduce or stop the supplemental o if they occur ambulatory o provision of supplemental o during exercise and activities of daily living this may be on its own or in addition to ltot the conditions provok ing exercise hypoxia are of course similar to the conditions mentioned previously the requirement for o in these circumstances depends on the degree of activity the patient is likely to achieve if already on ltot then it is likely that ambulatory o will be needed when away from home should there be significant dyspnoea without it such patients are often housebound and would only require it for only short periods the patient must understand that they need to use the o during the exerciseactivity not for recovery afterwards greater use should require actual proof that there is significant exercise hypoxia and dyspnoea and that o relieves these a month assessment is usually

nonmalignant respiratory disease copd cf fibrotic lung disease chapter palliative care general points palliative care is defined by the world health organization who as an approach that improves the qol of patients and their families facing the problems associated with lifethreatening illness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification impeccable assess ment and treatment of pain and other problems physical psychosocial and spiritual palliative care is moving away from being involved just at the end of life especially in developing countries when curative possibilities are less readily available and palliative treatments may be the only option in the uk patients may be under palliative care teams intermittently for symptom control respite care etc and may not see the service again for months or years within chest medicine palliative care is most commonly considered for patients with lung cancer and mesothelioma many other patients with pro gressive endstage respiratory disease such as copd cf and fibrotic lung disease also benefit from specific palliative interventions these two areas are discussed separately in this chapter although there is much overlap in the management general points chapter palliative care lung cancer and mesothelioma involve the specialist palliative care team early treat symptoms promptly an open discussion of patients fears is often helpful as is a calm and explicit logical approach to symptom management recognize problems are often mixed complex and multiple recognize that delirium dyspnoea and decreased mobility often herald the terminal phase of cancer pain aim to determine cause type and site start with simple analgesia and increase according to the who analgesic ladder moving from nonopioid analgesia paracetamol nsaids through weak opioids codeine tramadol to strong opioids morphine diamorphine fentanyl etc while also considering adjuvant therapy eg antidepressants antiepileptics reassess repeatedly and regularly if moving to morphine from a weak opioid mg morphine daily should be adequate given either hourly immediate release or hourly modifiedrelease preparations mg codeine qds is equivalent to mg total daily morphine if the first dose of morphine is no more effective than previous analgesia increase next dose by prescribe analgesia as required for breakthrough pain see box give drugs a chance to work at appropriate doses particularly if they have not had strong opioids before allows assessment of analgesic effect and side effects usually increase every rd day if required once pain is reasonably controlled morphine dose can be converted to slowrelease morphine by dividing total daily amount by two and giving that dose as modifiedrelease morphine hourly see box the additional breakthrough dose is of the total h dose eg if using mg modifiedrelease morphine bd then use an additional mg immediaterelease morphine sulfate for breakthrough pain treat drug side effects eg constipation nausea prescribe prophylactic laxatives with morphine warn people they may feel more drowsy if starting morphine or having dose increase but this usually settles within a few days patients with renal failure are more likely to develop opioid toxicity drowsiness confusion myoclonus as they have difficulty excreting morphine metabolites they may need alternatives to morphine eg oxycodone methadone alfentanil fentanyl if their pain is not controlled on lowdose morphine the addition of an antiinflammatory drug or steroids can be effective for bone pain and for liver capsule pain if there are hepatic metastases consider radiotherapy for localized pain in the chest related to cancer pleuritic pain consider pe treat any infection consider nsaid intercostal nerve block lung cancer and mesothelioma bone metastases causing local tenderness start a strong opioid if there is no improvement after three dose increases add an nsaid for a week trial if single site consider radiotherapy or intercostal nerve block if multiple sites consider bisphosphonates provided not hypocalcaemic eg mg of pamidronate iv every weeks neuropathic pain can be treated with tricyclic antidepressants eg amitriptyline started at mg nocte or nortriptyline or antiepileptics eg pregabalin started at mg bd or gabapentin in some cases there may be a role for lidocaine patches or capsaicin cream pain from chest drain tract metastases use analgesia and refer for radiotherapy consider referral to pain clinic or specialist centre for further intervention such as a intercostal nerve block transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tens cervical cordotomy or complementary therapies box treatment of breakthrough pain if already on nonopioid analgesic give one extra dose of the regular analgesic if already on a regular oral opioid give hourly oral dose of total h dose eg mgday mg dose if already on continuous sc infusion of morphinediamorphine give hourly dose eg mgh mg dose sc consider increasing regular analgesic dose if the breakthrough pain occurs before the next regular dose if there is no response to the additional breakthrough pain treatment repeat after h if nonopioid or h if opioid with same dose if still no response consider changing from nonopioid to weak opioid or weak opioid to strong opioid box conversions between opioids different opioids at equivalent doses do not provide greater analgesic efficacy but offer alternative routes for administration to ensure adequate absorption and minimize side effects usually toxicity and confusion oral morphine to sc morphine conversion factor is eg mgh oral morphine mg sc morphine oral morphine to diamorphine infusion conversion factor is eg mgh oral morphine mgh sc diamorphine oral morphine to h

depression anxiety than those with terminal cancer but they are less likely to receive specific treatment for their emotional problems or any targeted palliative care it may be appropriate therefore to shift the focus in patients with severe endstage respiratory disease away from management of acute exacerbations towards a more palliative approach to care dyspnoea dyspnoea is frightening and made worse by anxiety and panic patients may decrease their mobility to avoid dyspnoea and subsequently become more deconditioned dyspnoea may be due to the underlying lung disease or an additional

deconditioning and further worsening dyspnoea on more minimal exertion aims of rehabilitation to reduce disability in people with chronic lung disease to improve qol and restore independence to diminish the health care burden of disease early studies demonstrated there were improvements in functional status with pr despite no change in severity of airflow obstruction metaanalysis of rcts where pr included exercise training for at least weeks although the content was varied confirmed the benefit of reha bilitation with statistically and clinically significant improvements in func tional or maximal exercise capacity andor qol symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue are improved and patients gain an enhanced sense of control over their condition other benefits of pr patients across the disease severity spectrum of copd including those with severe airflow obstruction can benefit from pr studies show patients who completed a rehabilitation course may have fewer hospital admissions for exacerbations than those who had not had rehabilitation and hospital stays were shorter days vs days respiratory muscle training improves dyspnoea but not exercise capacity or healthrelated qol above aerobic training highintensity lower limb aerobic training is recommended rather than lowintensity training supplemental strength training improves muscle strength but does not provide additional benefit to exercise capacity or healthrelated qol than aerobic training alone early pr is recommended after a copd exacerbation it is safe and improves exercise tolerance healthrelated qol and reduces hospital admissions shortterm programmes achieve overall similar outcome benefits across the spectrum of patient disability a minimum programme length of weeks is recommended decline in exercise

gives increased stability when taking biopsies and allows the patient to cough and spit out secretions more easily if this is not possible a mouth guard is used and access obtained through the mouth all sections of the bronchial tree should be visually inspected including the cords and trachea cxr or ct may help localize the area of concern so specimen site can then be targeted this increases the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in cases of suspected lung cancer avoid unnecessary suction as this can increase hypoxia chapter bronchoscopy sampling techniques bronchial washings are taken by

usually the inside forearm a range of allergens are available commercially fresh produce should be used for suspected fruit and vegetable hypersensitivity prick the skin through the allergen drop using a needle do not draw blood this should be with a calibrated lancet mm held vertically or a hypodermic needle held at to the skin the positive control is usually histamine and the negative control the diluent usually glycerinated saline read the histamine control after min and the allergen extracts after min a positive result is an itchy weal which should be compared with the controls as some subjects react to the skin prick alone dermatographism different test solutions are standardized to give a mean weal diameter of mm across sensitive subjects a weal of mm or more is considered positive indicating sensitization a positive result does not prove that the clinical symptoms are due to bronchial hyperresponsiveness to the tested allergen but do raise clinical suspicion positive

increases willingness of patients to have further procedures without worsening adverse event profile other benzodiazepines eg diazepam and lorazepam have also been used but midazolam has particular suitability with rapid peak effect and relatively short halflife natural variability in action of cytochrome p cyp a and a responsible for benzodiazepine metabolism may prolong elimination halflife by up to sixfold flumazenil benzodiazepine antagonist reverses benzodiazepine oversedation and must be immediately available although administration should not be routine flumazenil has a shorter

both benzodiazepine and opioid initial reversal with flumazenil rather than naloxone recommended unless the patient has received particularly high dose of opioid drugs used for sedation addition of an opioid to midazolam for bronchoscopy improves procedural cough reduces lidocaine usage and increases patient procedural tolerance most frequent combination agents used for bronchoscopy are midazolam and fentanylalfentanil opioids should be administered and allowed to reach maximal effect prior to administration of midazolam risk of oversedation may increase when using combination agents although several studies fail to show an increase in clinically significant adverse events other drugs propofol and its prodrug fospropofol are sedativehypnotics that exert their actions partly by increasing

is recommended elderly patients are likely to require lower doses of sedatives and may suffer with prolonged aftereffects eg amnesia and coordination impairment a ncepod report for elderly patients undergoing therapeutic gi endoscopy recommended that no more than mg should be initially drawn up for patients aged other comorbidities likely to require dose modification include hepatic impairment heart failure and renal impairment concomitant medications eg antifungals antiretrovirals ccbs and macrolide antibiotics inhibit cytochrome p a which also metabolizes benzodiazepines and opioids and

transmission occurs when particles in a tissue move together and have coherent vibration attenuation loss of us energy occurs due to wave absorption scatter and refraction absorption occurs when particles do not move together and have chaotic vibration generating heat higher frequencies ie shorter wavelengths are more likely to be absorbed than transmitted giving poorer depth penetration but better resolution deeper structures lead to greater wave attenuation travels further through tissue and us machines compensate for this using time gain compensation tgc which can be finetuned using

thorax suppl iiii tracheostomy indications and techniques complications chapter chapter tracheostomy indications and techniques temporary tracheostomy is usually performed as an adjunct to assisted ven tilation such patients are now often returned to respiratory wards for decannulation with the potential for complications to occur there indications for tracheostomy on the icu no uniform agreement after a period of time following intubation with an endotracheal tube improved patient communication with cuff deflationtube fenestration reduced sedation possible reduction in laryngeal damage the evidence for this is limited nursing care potentially easier facilitation of weaning there is no evidence for a reduced incidence of aspiration or pneumonia with tracheostomy vs endotracheal tube usual practice is to convert from endotracheal tube to tracheostomy at days if ventilation is likely to be needed beyond days earlier conversion for those predicted to require days ventilation is not beneficial except in reducing sedation conversion beyond days is considered best practice and certainly by days percutaneous vs surgical tracheostomy percutaneous tracheos tomy pt can be performed on the icu immediately once the decision is made and is quicker than conventional tracheostomy there are a variety of pt techniques griggs guidewire with dilating forceps and the ciaglia multiple or single blue rhino dilator approach preferably with endoscopic verification of placement in the blue rhino system a curved coneshaped dilator is slid over a guidewire and introduced into the tracheal lumen between the second and third tracheal rings until the hole is large enough to accept the required tracheostomy tube this technique requires controlled force and there is significant potential for traumatic damage the fit of the tracheostomy tube is tighter with less stomal infection less postoperative haemorrhage but the longterm complications of the two techniques are similar however units with prompt access to surgical tracheostomy tend to use this whenever possible due to the potential traumatic damage from the percutaneous approach humidification of the inspired gas is always required to prevent the buildup of thick viscid mucus humidification can only be withdrawn in longterm tracheostomy patients after several weeks or months decannulation tracheostomy may still be required to administer intermittent ventilation reduce ventilatory dead space aid respiratory secretion clearance limit aspiration when cuffed and bypass any upper airway obstruction this is weighed against the consequences of a trache ostomy increased tendency to aspirate because of a reduced ability to swallow reduced ability to talk and the increased infection brought about from a foreign body in the trachea as well as bypassing the upper airway thus decannulation should be carried out as soon as adequate clearance of secretions ie good cough and thin secretions low probability that thick mucous plugs will block off large airways and need urgent suctioning indications and techniques no upper airway obstruction no significant aspiration can be checked by drinking methylene blue and then suctioning although a small amount is not an absolute contraindication no need to continue ventilation or simply reduce dead space for maintenance of gas exchange conversion to niv if necessary is possible and has been demonstrated to work adequately while tracheostomy capped respiratory physiotherapists can often help with these assessments the ability to cope adequately without the tracheostomy can be repeatedly determined and for increasing periods by capping the tube with the cuff fully deflated and preferably with a fenestrated tube to maximally reduce airflow resistance the addition of a speaking valve does not replicate the physiological challenge of decannulation as there is still relief from a signifi cant amount of dead space ventilation once a tube has been removed the stoma can close over very quickly making reinsertion difficult introducing a guidewire over which the old tube is removed and the new can be inserted is useful if there is con cern that reinsertion is a possibility a thin suction tube with the connec tor cut off will suffice as a guidewire alternatively a minitracheostomy can be inserted as an interim measure the final decision to decannulate is often delayed unnecessarily sooner rather than later is usually better as the improved swallowing reduced aspiration better coughing reduced irritation reduced chance of infection can together outweigh the apparent advantage of easy access to the airway for suction available tube options tracheostomy tubes can be cuffed or uncuffed if ventilation is not necessary and aspiration is not a problem cuffs are not required some patients can be adequately ventilated even with the cuff down or no cuff at all this is usually in patients with normal lungs where the compliance is good inflation pressures therefore low and only small amounts of air leak upwards through the nose and mouth tracheostomy tubes can be either single or double ie with an inner and outer tube double tubes allow better cleaning and therefore reduce the chance of the lumen obstructing but the diameter of the lumen is of course less for a similarsized external diameter tracheostomy tubes can be fenestrated to allow exhalation via the larynx to aid talking the fenestration can be closed off with a nonfenestrated inner tube should intermittent ventilation still be required speaking valves are available that fit on the tracheostomy allowing inspi ration via the tracheostomy but closing and allowing expiration via the lar ynx if cuff down andor fenestration open they effectively still reduce dead space maintain access for suctioning but allow talking in the very obese tracheostomy tubes are often too short and too curved to cope with the increased distance between skin and trachea tubes with adjustable flanges that allow customized intratracheal lengths are use ful here but do not usually come with inner tubes making more difficult the task of keeping the tracheostomy tube free of secretion buildup chapter tracheostomy complications displacement or obstruction evidenced by failing gas exchange unexpected ventilator pressures patient may be able to talk despite cuff inflated if available use capnography to detect oscillating fico and determine if obstructed or not remove inner tube and check for secretion buildup try passing suction catheter

there any evidence of a vq mismatch assessed from the aa gradient for o appendix blood gases and acidbase balance acidbase balance normal ranges ph h nmoll paco base excess mmoll interpretation acidbase relationships are best plotted as a paco vs ph graph because these are the two measurements made by a blood gas machine everything else to do with acidbase balance is calculated this is shown in fig a normal acidbase is the area labelled n the ph between and the paco around kpa as ventilation is decreased or increased paco going up or down respectively the ph will change the amount depending on the buffering capacity of the blood co is an acid gas combining with water to give h and hco ions without buffering the ph would fall disastrously following small rises in paco this buffering capacity depends mainly on hb and other proteins producing the normal buffer line running through n on the graph therefore acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation will move the patient up and down this line in the direction b or c respectively if the hypoventila tion at point b becomes chronic eg as it may in copd then the kidney retains bicarbonate by excreting h to try and correct the ph towards normal and the patient moves onto a new iso hco buffer line displaced to the right eg the one labelled meql meql the degree of dis placement represents the metabolic component to the acidbase status and in this case because the hco has risen will be higher than the normal figure of about meql when the raised figure is quoted relative to the normal meql by subtracting this is called the base excess thus buffer lines to the right of the normal buffer line represent a metabolic alkalosis or base excess these figures are calculated assuming a normal or standard paco called the standard bicarbonate sbc on the blood gas machine printout or standard base excess usually be the other similar figures on some printouts usually hco and tco are calculated at the patients actual paco and are not much use chronic hyperventilation eg at altitude due to the hypoxia produces the opposite a resorption of h by the kidney and the buffer line shifts to the left giving a negative value for the base excess a base deficit thus a metabolic acidosis compensates for a respiratory alkalosis note that these corrections rarely bring the ph back to normal as there needs to be an error signal to keep the correction process going a metabolic acidosis such as in ketoacidosis will also move the line to the left a producing a base deficit or negative base excess followed by hyperventilation to try and correct it ie a respiratory alkalosis to correct a metabolic acidosis this pure ventilatory stimulation in the absence of abnormal lungs often produces deep breathing with little increase in rate and is called kussmauls breathing thus lines to the left of the normal buffer line represent a metabolic acidosis or base deficit acidbase balance important pointa metabolic acidosis eg due to anaerobic metabolism and hence lactic acid production can reverse the compensatory meta bolic alkalosis to chronic hypercapnia eg during a copd exacerbation with severe hypoxia thus removing the evidence for previous chronic co retention finally a metabolic alkalosis eg during hypokalaemia when the kidney is forced to use h instead of k to swap for the sodium that needs resorbing from the tubular fluid moves the buffer line to the right d but with only limited hypoventilation available to compensate due to the inevi table ventilatory stimulation the attendant hypoxaemia produces thus the mixture of respiratory and metabolic contributions to a patients acidbase disturbance can be established by plotting the paco and ph on the graph anion gap the anion gap na k cl hco shows the amount of other anions apart from cl and hco that exists and helps differentiate the cause of any metabolic acidosis depending on methods of measurement the normal value is between and mmoll or meql and mainly due to albumin high anion gap indicates loss of hco without a subsequent increase in cl electroneutrality is maintained by increase in anions such as ketones lactate po and so because these anions are not part of the anion gap calculation a high anion gap results fig a acidbase balance pacoph lines running top left to bottom right are the isobicarbonate lines labelled as absolute hco in brackets or as a base excessdeficit relative to a hco of meql hence can be metabolic acidosis or metabolic alkalosis appendix blood gases and acidbase balance an acidosis with a normal anion gap will be a simple hco cl exchange such as might occur eg in renal tubular acidosis acetazolamide therapy hco loss from profuse diarrhoea an anion gap is likely to be present eg when the

see fig a and table a a fall in ph more acidotic or a rise in body temperature will move the dis sociation curve to the right this has the effect of making the pao higher for any given sao eg at ph a measured saturation eg by oximetry of is equivalent to a higher pao of kpa mmhg than the usual kpa mmhg a rise in body temperature to c will do the same and the effects of ph and temperature are additive conversely for a given pao pyrexia and acidosis will lower the sao and thus o carriage to the tissues a pao of kpa mmhg will normally give an sao of but if the temperature rises to c and ph falls to then the sao falls to increasing dpg levels shift the curve to the right but levels fluctuate unpredictably and any changes are small changes in body temperature are often the reason why measured pulse oximetry saturations apparently do not agree with the measured blood gases ph is taken into account in the theoretical calculation of sao by blood gas analysers but the patients correct body temperature is rarely fig a hb dissociation curve arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen tension entered and thus is not taken into account this is particularly important in hypothermia when the curve is leftshifted leading to impaired o unload ing furthermore an apparently adequate oximetry reading can mask a low pao which will further lessen o availability to the tissues although some what

peak flow measurements and co transfer respiratory muscle function body plethysmography and lung volumes peak flow reference ranges cardiopulmonary exercise testing cpet appendix lung function and testing flowvolume loop a good start to understanding lung function tests is the flowvolume loop see fig a this plots inspiratory and expiratory flow against lung vol ume during a maximal expiratory and maximal inspiratory manoeuvre at the beginning of expiration from a full breath in the expiratory muscles are at their strongest the lungs at their largest and hence the airways are at their most open a because the lungs are at their largest the radial attachments to the airways effectively the alveolarcapillary membranes and their connective tissue are pulling the hardest and supporting the air ways against dynamic compression during the exhalation manoeuvre this means that the highest flow rates are possible at the beginning of the blow hence the sudden rise to a pefr in the first ms or so of the forced breath out b this is the peak flow and is essentially what a peak flow meter measures see fig a as the lung empties and the lung volume drops the dilatory pull on the airways from the radial attachments of the surrounding lung tissue reduces c hence the airways narrow and become less supported and are less able to resist dynamic compression this means that the maximal airflow obtainable regardless of effort falls too eventually the expiratory muscles come to the end of their travel and cannot squeeze the chest anymore also increasingly with age the small air ways may actually close off preventing any more emptying d the volume at which this begins to happen is called the closing volume as maximal inspiration starts although the inspiratory muscles are at their strongest the airways are at their smallest thus flow rates start low and increase as the airways open up however as the lung expands the inspira tory muscles are approaching the end of their travel and are weakening this means the flow rates fall again hence the different rounded appearance of the inspiratory limb of the flowvolume curve tlc rv d c b a expiratory fow inspiratory fow fig a flowvolume loop flowvolume loop thus normally the inspiratory and expiratory flow rates depend on lung volume and are termed volumedependent if there is a fixed upper airway narrowing such as from a solid hard tumour partially blocking the trachea then the size of the airway at this point may become so narrow that it now limits maximal flows however its diameter will vary very little with lung volumes and hence flow will become volumeindependent fig a shows this at a the rise in flow will initially be normal but at some point the maxi mum flow imposed by the upper airway narrowing will cut in b from that point onwards the flow rate will be fixed at this maximum c until at much lower lung volumes the lower recoil and narrowing of the small airways again determine the maximum flow d the flowvolume curve has been severely clipped with a squareish appearance the same clipped appear ance will be present on the inspiratory limb e giving rise to the socalled square box appearance sometimes such upper airways restriction may be variable rather than fixed and only obstruct during inspiration eg paralysed and collapsing vocal cords due to the obstructing elements being sucked in and then blown open again on expiration thus a square inspiratory limb but normal expiratory limb provides evidence of a mobile extrathoracic upper airways obstruction conversely a mobile intrathoracic upper airway obstruction eg soft fleshy tumour at the carina or retrosternal thyroid may obstruct more during expiration when the expiratory effort is compressing the lung compared with inspiration when the chest is being expanded thus a square expiratory limb but normal inspiratory limb is evidence of a variable intrathoracic upper airways obstruction sometimes ratios of maximal inspiratory to maximal expiratory flows are used to characterize the intra or extrathoracic airway obstruction a d b c e expiration inspiration fig a volumeindependent flow appendix lung function and testing flowvolume loop the other more common causes of airway obstruction are due to nar rowing of the lower airways asthma copd in these conditions the air way calibre and thus flow rates still remains dependent on lung volume hence the flow rates decrease as the lung volume decreases but particu larly decrease at low lung volumes this is because resistance to flow is pro portional to the airway radius raised to the power of r and therefore most significant when airways are already small hence increasing airflow obstruction produces expiratory flowvolume curves like those in fig a this greater effect of small airways narrowing at low lung volumes has led some to report flow rates at for example expired lung volume or averaged between and of the total expired lung volume airways can be so small that during expiration they begin closing off earlier than normal the closing volume hence a full breath out is not possible producing air trapping and a raised rv a sensitive tests of small airways narrowing have to concentrate on flows at low lung volumes and peak flow measurements are relatively insensitive note however that peak flow measurements are the most sensitive to upper airway narrowing and a good way to follow changes in upper airway narrowing during for example radiotherapy for a central airway obstructing lung cancer a rv expiration fig a expiratory flowvolume

against time rather than flow against volume the two essential measures are fev and vc the vc is the maximum amount of air that can be blown out completely this will be reduced if the lungs are stiff preventing a full breath in the inspiratory muscles are weak preventing a full breath in or the airways are narrowed such that the small airways collapse during expiration preventing a full breath out the fev is the amount forced expiratory volume that can be blown out in s because the value is taken over a second a much longer period of flow is being captured during the breath out than the pefr but despite this the measurement is still being made when the airways are larger it is less dependent on effort and generally more robust the ratio of the two figures fevvc tells us about the degree of airflow obstruction a ratio of fevvc of less than about indicates airflow obstruction this ratio is very useful because it is hardly affected by age sex height ethnic origin etcit is selfnormalizing the individual measures of fev and vc do need corrections for the above factors and are usually quoted as predicted the range of normality is considerable and it may not be clear if results are simply at the bottom end of normal or considerably reduced from the patients normally much higher figures serial measure ments indicating continuing deterioration may be the first clue only if the fevvc ratio is normal can the vc be confidently used to infer whether there is a reduced total lung volume such as from ild a low vc with nor mal fevvc ratio is called a restrictive pattern a low fevvc ratio is called an obstructive pattern and a reduced vc cannot then be confidently used to infer that the total lung volume is also reduced and indeed may even be increased because of air trapping a small print fact is that the fevvc ratio may actually be raised in ild as the airways are better supported by the fibrosed radial attachments which reduces dynamic compression thus increasing expiratory flow compared to that expected for the lung volume the slope of the volumetime plot from a spirometer is effectively the flow at any particular point because flow is dropping during expiration the slope progressively flattens off however if there is any fixed upper airways obstruction as previously discussed the expiratory flow rate will be con stant for a while and hence the spirometer line will be straighter than usual an interesting index to detect possible upper airway obstruction the empey index has been described empey index fev ml pefr lmin because pefr is clipped first by the presence of upper airflow obstruc tion relative to the fev the above index gets larger with such a problem a figure over is suggestive of upper airflow obstruction but it is only a pointer and there will be false positives and negatives spirometry peak flow measurements and co transfer although oneoff measures of lung function can be made more interest ing information comes from serial measurements eg in asthma pefr will fluctuate with characteristic morning dips spirometryhow to do it everyone has their own way to do spirometry see table a but this is a way that works for the authors say to the patient this is a test of how big your lungs are and how fast you can empty them what i would like you to do is take an enormous breath in the biggest you can manage then seal your lips around the tube and blow as hard and as fast and as long as you possibly can then demonstrate the manoeuvre yourself with a spare tube not necessarily connected to the spirometer so that they can then mimic it whilst they are blowing say excellent well done keep blowing come on come on come on keep blowing there are various recommendations as to numbers of blow etc these are the arguments table a spirometer tips standing or sitting high intrathoracic pressure generated may cause the patient to pass out therefore sitting down is safer but better and more consistent figures are obtained standing have a chair behind patient to sit on if dizzy nose clip prevents escape through the nose which would give falsely low figures but is uncomfortable vast majority of patients do not need it but if the line appears to fall off towards the end of the blow or inconsistent volumes try a nose clip best of three blows needed to demonstrate that maximal blow has been consistently achieved usually by seeing two identical tracings a device showing the actual spirometer tracing is extremely helpful if two tracings are identical this is probably enough but may need more if blowing is erratic until satisfied it is maximal keep going to end of page s or not needed to establish correct vc therefore if line still rising then vc not reached but have to stop somewhere in restrictive disease or normals usually maximal by s in obstructive disease may need to do a slow vc to establish real value which can be much larger than the forced vc fvc due to dynamic compression repeat with a submaximal effort similar to above it is sometimes useful to ask patient to repeat the expiratory manoeuvre with slightly less effort when emphysema suspected this will often give better expiratory volume in s and the vc which would suggest major dynamic airways compression appendix lung function and testing co transfer usually done in the lung function laboratory and it essentially measures the amount of gasexchanging surface area available a gas mixture containing co is inhaled the breath held for s and then exhaled the amount of co that has disappeared by crossing the alveolar capillary membrane and being taken up by red cells is calculated a correction for the hb concen tration is required as the amount of co transferred will fall as the avail able hb is reduced the total amount of co transferred is the tlco total lung tl when divided by the total lung volume during the breathhold it is called the kco gas transfer per unit lung volume the total lung vol ume reached by the co is the amount breathed in plus the amount of air already in the lung at the start of the breath in this is measured by including helium in the inhaled gas mixture that is diluted by the air already in the lung by comparing inspired helium concentration with expired this total lung volume can be calculated the tlco and kco are reduced most in emphysema when alveoli have been destroyed the tlco and kco are reduced in ild where the alveolar capillary membrane may be thick enough to reduce co passage the kco may also be raised and tlco normal when lungs are poorly expanded by say weak respiratory muscles because the lung is more concentrated and transfers co better when quoted per unit volume the kco may also be raised for a few days when there has been profuse lung haemorrhage as can occur in eg sle wegeners and goodpastures this is because the free red cells lining the alveoli take up co directly and falsely elevate the figure as the hb is broken down the kco returns to normal unless there is another bleed this helps to distinguish rebleeding from other causes of lung infiltrates such as infection this test requires more cooperation than simple spirometry as well as a minimum inspired volume and therefore cannot always be obtained spirometry peak flow measurements and co transfer appendix lung function and testing respiratory muscle function body plethysmography and lung volumes respiratory muscle function respiratory failure and small vcs may be due to weak respiratory muscles it is therefore useful to be able to assess inspiratory and expiratory muscle power there may be global weakness or specific inspiratory weakness usu ally due to diaphragm paralysis in the clinic the simplest test is a lying and standing vc if the diaphragm is paralysed then on lying down the abdomi nal contents will push up the diaphragm and limit inspiration on standing the abdominal contents drop and aid inspiration a fall in vc of on lying down is probably normal a fall of is suspicious of diaphragm paralysis a fall of is abnormal and suggests significant usually bilateral diaphragm paralysis in the laboratory there are various ways to test respiratory muscle function the patient can blow against a pressure meter after a maximum inspiration and inspire against the meter after a full expiration this is of course highly effortdependent a manoeuvre such as a sniff is very stereotypic and patients can reproduce this measuring the inspiratory pressure produced at the nose during this manoeuvre is a rough and ready way of screening for inspiratory muscle weakness more accurate assessments of inspiratory muscle function particularly the diaphragm can be obtained using two semiinflated balloons introduced via the mouth and oesophagus placed above and below the dia phragm and connected to pressure transducers the transdiaphragmatic pressures during maximal inspiratory efforts sniffing and breathing to tlc all provide reproducible measures of diaphragm function but depend on good cooperation and effort by the patient activating the phrenic nerve directly with a superficial electrical stimulator or by using highintensity magnetic stimu lation over the nerve roots of cc whilst measuring transdiaphragmatic pressures provides a noneffortdependent way to test diaphragm function body plethysmography requires the patient to climb into an airtight cabinet and breathe through a shuttered mouthpiece connected to the out side world it has two particular advantages over simpler lung function tests it is able to measure the total lung volume or capacity tlc in the thorax and it provides a measure of airways obstruction involving little or no effort by the patient the other main method of measuring tlc involves helium dilution as described during the tlco measurement above however in the presence of lower airways obstruction the helium may not reach all parts of the lung during the s breathhold and the volume calculated from this dilution will therefore be lower than the real tlc the body plethysmograph relies on the pressure changes that occur when all the air in the chest is alternately compressed and expanded by the patient making breathing efforts against an airway closed by a shutter at the mouth the pressure changes produced in the oral cavity vs those in the box are then proportional to the volume of air being compressed and rarefied thus allowing calculation of the vol ume in the chest at the time note that this volume will include any bullae respiratory muscle function and lung volumes or pneumothorax and the difference between the plethysmographic lung volume and the helium dilution volume will reflect the bullaepneumothorax volumes as well as areas not reached by the helium due to increased airways resistance measurement of airways resistance with the body box relies on a similar principle if there were no airways resistance then breathing in and out would not compress or rarefy the air in the chest with increasing resist ance the air in the chest will be compressed during expiration and rarefied on inspiration it is this phenomenon that allows calculation of the airways resistance during quiet breathing or panting the latter ensures the vocal cords are fully open and not contributing to the measured resistance see fig a and table a tlc vc vc rv frc restrictive normal obstructive tlc
