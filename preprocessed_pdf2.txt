general approach the emergency department the role of the emergency department the emergency department ed occupies a key position in terms of the interface between primary and secondary care it has a high public proﬁ le many patients attend without referral but some are referred by nhs direct minor injury units general practitioners gps and other medical practitioners the ed manages patients with a huge variety of medical problems many of the patients who attend have painful andor distressing disorders of recent origin priorities are to make lifesaving interventions to provide analgesia to identify relevant issues investigations and commence treatment to decide upon need for admission or discharge ed staff work as a team traditional roles are often blurred with the important issue being what clinical skills a member of staff is capable of ed staff include nurses including nurse practitioners nurse consultants health care assistants doctors permanent and ﬁ xedterm reception and administrative staff receptionists secretaries managers radiographers including reporting radiographers other specialist staff eg psychiatric liaison nurses plaster technicians physiotherapists paramedic practitioners physician assistants occupational therapists cliniced ward staff supporting staff security porters cleaners police physical resources a principal focus of the ed is to provide immediate resuscitation for patients who present with emergency conditions in terms of sheer numbers more patients attend with minor conditions and injuries often presenting quite a challenge for them to be seen and treated in a timely fashion different departments have systems to suit their own particular needs but most have a resuscitation room an area for patients on trolleys and an area for ambulant patients with less serious problems or injuries paediatric patients are seen in a separate area from adults in addition every ed requires facilities for applying casts exploring and suturing wounds obtaining xrays and examining patients with eye problems discharge from the ed to work efﬁ ciently the overall hospital system needs to enable easy ﬂ ow of patients out of the ed options available for continuing care of patients who leave the ed include discharge home with no followup discharge home with gp andor other community supportfollowup discharge with hospital clinic followup arranged admission to hospital for further investigation and treatment transfer to another hospital with more specialist facilities wwwketabpezeshkicom the emergency department emergency department staff beyond the emergency department in addition to their roles in providing direct clinical care in their departments many ed staff provide related clinical care in other settings and ways short stay wards sometimes called clinical decision units where emergency care can be continued by ed staff the intention is for admissions to these units to be short most of the patients admitted to such wards are observed for relatively short periods hr and undergo assessments at an early stage to decide about the need for discharge or longerterm admission outpatient clinics enable patients with a variety of clinical problems eg burns soft tissue injuries and infections to be followed up by ed staff planned theatre lists run by ed specialists are used by some hospitals to manage some simple fractures eg angulated distal radial fractures telemedicine advice to satellite and minor injury units emergency medicine in other settings as the delivery of emergency care continues to develop patients with emergency problems are now receiving assessment and treatment in a variety of settings these include minor injury units acute medical assessment units and walkin centres traditional distinctions between emergency medicine acute medicine and primary care have become blurred wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach note keeping general aspects it is impossible to overemphasize the importance of note keeping doctors and nurse practitioners each treat hundreds of patients every month with the passage of time it is impossible to remember all aspects relating to these cases yet it may be necessary to give evidence in court about them years after the event the only reference will be the notes made much earlier medicolegally the ed record is the prime source of evidence in negligence cases if the notes are deﬁ cient it may not be feasible to defend a claim even if negligence has not occurred a court may consider that the standard of the notes reﬂ ects the general standard of care sloppy illegible or incomplete notes reﬂ ect badly on the individual in contrast if notes are neat legible appropriate and detailed those reviewing the case will naturally expect the general standards of care in terms of history taking examination and level of knowledge to be competent the data protection and access to medical records acts give patients right of access to their medical notes remember whenever writing notes that the patient may in the future read exactly what has been written follow the basic general rules listed below layout follow a standard outline presenting complaint indicate from whom the history has been obtained eg the patient a relative or ambulance personnel avoid attributing events to certain individuals eg patient was struck by joe bloggs previous relevant history note recent ed attendances include family and social history an elderly woman with a colles fracture of her dominant hand may be able to manage at home with routine followup provided she is normally in good health and has good family or other support but if she lives alone in precarious social conditions without such support then admission on social grounds may be required current medications remember to ask about nonprescribed drugs including recreational herbal and homeopathic women may not volunteer the oral contraceptive pill ocp as medication unless speciﬁ cally asked enquire about allergies to medications and document the nature of this reaction examination ﬁ ndings as well as ve features document relevant ve ﬁ ndings eg the absence of neck stiffness in a patient with headache and pyrexia always document the side of the patient which has been injured for upper limb injuries note whether the patient is left or right handed use left and right not l and r document if a patient is abusive or aggressive but avoid nonmedical judgemental terms eg drunk investigation ﬁ ndings record clearly working diagnosis for patients being admitted this may be a differential diagnostic list sometimes a problem list can help wwwketabpezeshkicom note keeping treatment given document drugs including dose time and route of administration see current british national formulary bnf for guidance include medications given in the ed as well as therapy to be continued eg course of antibiotics note the number and type of sutures or staples used for wound closure eg nylon sutures advice and followup arrangements document if the patient andor relative is given preprinted instructions eg pop care indicate when if the patient needs to be reviewed eg see gp in days for suture removal or other arrangement eg fracture clinic in one week record advice about whenwhy the patient should return for review especially if there is a risk of a rare but serious complication eg for low back pain see gp if not better in week return to the ed at once if bladderbowel problem or numb groinbottom that might be features of cauda equina syndrome basic rules write legibly in ballpoint pen ideally black which photocopies well always date and time the notes sign the notes and print your name and status below make your notes concise and to the point use simple line drawings or preprinted sheets for woundinjury descriptions avoid idiosyncratic abbreviations never make rude or judgemental comments always document the name grade and specialty of any doctor from whom you have received advice when referring or handing a patient over always document the time of referralhandover together with the name grade and specialty of the receiving doctor inform the gp by letter b liaising with gps p even if the patient is admitted most eds have computerized systems that generate such letters in complex cases send also a copy of ed notes with results of investigations pro formas increasing emphasis on evidencebased guidelines and protocols has been associated with the introduction of protocols for many patient presentations and conditions bear in mind the fact that for some patients satisfactory completion of a pro forma may not adequately capture all of the information required electronic records in an electronic age there has been an understandable move towards trying to introduce electronic patient records the potential advantages are obvious particularly in relation to rapidly ascertaining past medical history when completing electronic records practitioners need to follow the same principles as those outlined above for written records access to old records can make a huge contribution to decision making one potential advantage of electronic records is that they can be accessed rapidly compared with older systems requiring a porter to search through the medical records store and retrieve paperbased notes wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach radiological requests i am glad to say that in this country there is no need to carry out unnecessary tests as a form of insurance it is not in this country desirable or indeed necessary that over protective and over examination work should be done merely and purely and simply as i say to protect oneself against possible litigation judge fallon quoted by oscar craig chairman cases committee medical protection society requesting investigations the royal college of radiologists booklet making the best use of a department of clinical radiology guidelines for doctors th edn london rcr contains very useful information and is strongly recommended general aspects an xray is no substitute for careful thorough clinical examination it is usually unnecessary to request xrays to conﬁ rm the clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated fractures of the nose coccyx a single rib or toes other than the big toe if in doubt about the need for xrays or the speciﬁ c test required consider relevant guidelines eg ottawa rules for ankle injuries b p andor discuss with senior ed staff or radiologist when requesting xrays describe the indicationmechanism of injury clinical ﬁ ndings including the side involved right or left spelt out in full not abbreviated and the suspected clinical diagnosis this is important for the radiologist reporting the ﬁ lms without the advantage of being able to examine the patient do not worry about specifying exactly which xray views are required the radiographer will know the standard views that are needed based on the information provided eg ap simpliﬁ ed apical oblique views for a patient with suspected anterior shoulder dislocation in unusual cases discuss with senior ed staff radiographer or radiologist always consider the possibility of pregnancy in women of childbearing age before requesting an xray of the abdomen pelvis lumbar spine hips or thighs if the clinical indication for xray is overriding tell the radiographer who will attempt to shield the foetusgonads if the risks beneﬁ ts of xrays in pregnant or possibly pregnant women are not obvious consult senior ed or radiology staff xray reporting system many hospitals have systems so that all ed xrays are reported by a specialist within hr reports of any missed abnormalities are returned with the xrays to the ed for the attention of senior staff so that appropriate action can be taken system for identifying abnormalities in addition to the formal reporting system described above a system is commonly used whereby the radiographer taking the ﬁ lms applies a sticky red dot to hard copy xray ﬁ lms andor request card or to the equivalent electronic image if they identify an abnormality this alerts other clinical staff to the possibility of abnormal ﬁ ndings wwwketabpezeshkicom triage triage the nature of ed work means that a sorting system is required to ensure that patients with the most immediately lifethreatening conditions are seen ﬁ rst a triage process aims to categorize patients based on their medical need and the available departmental resources one most commonly used process in the uk is the national triage scale table as soon as a patient arrives in the ed heshe should be assessed by a dedicated triage nurse a senior experienced individual with considerable common sense this nurse should provide any immediate interventions needed eg elevating injured limbs applying ice packs or splints and giving analgesia and initiate investigations to speed the patients journey through the department eg ordering appropriate xrays patients should not have to wait to be triaged it is a brief assessment which should take no more than a few minutes three points require emphasis triage is a dynamic process the urgency and hence triage category with which a patient requires to be seen may change with time for example a middleaged man who hobbles in with an inversion ankle injury is likely to be placed in triage category green if in the waiting room he becomes pale sweaty and complains of chest discomfort he would require prompt retriage into category orange placement in a triage category does not imply a diagnosis or even the lethality of a condition eg an elderly patient with colicky abdominal discomfort vomiting and absolute constipation would normally be placed in category yellow and a possible diagnosis would be bowel obstruction the cause may be a neoplasm which has already metastasized and is hence likely to be ultimately fatal triage has its own problems in particular patients in nonurgent categories may wait inordinately long periods of time whilst patients who have presented later but with conditions perceived to be more urgent are seen before them patients need to be aware of this and to be informed of likely waiting times uncomplaining elderly patients can often be poorly served by the process table national triage scale colour time to be seen by doctor immediate red immediately very urgent orange within min urgent yellow within hr standard green within hr nonurgent blue within hr wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach discharge referral and handover most patients seen in the ed are examined investigated treated and discharged home either with no followup or advice to see their gp for suture removal wound checks etc give these patients andor attending relativefriend clear instructions on when to attend the gps surgery and an indication of the likely course of events as well as any features that they should look out for to prompt them to seek medical help prior to this formal written instructions are particularly useful for patients with minor head injury b p and those with limbs in pop or other forms of cast immobilization b casts and their problems p the referral of patients to an inpatient team can cause considerable anxiety misunderstanding and potential conﬂ ict between ed staff and other disciplines before making the referral the following should be considered is it appropriate to refer this patient to the inpatient team usually this will be obvious for example a middleaged man with a history of crushing chest pain and an ecg showing an acute mi clearly requires urgent management in the ed and rapid admission for further investigation and treatment similarly an elderly lady who has fallen is unable to weightbear and has a fractured neck of femur will require analgesia inpatient care and surgery however difﬁ cult situations occur where the clinical situation is less clear for example if a man experienced min of atypical chest pain has a normal ecg and chest xray cxr and is anxious to go home or a lady has no apparent fracture on xray but cannot weightbear is there appropriate information to make this decision this requires a balance between availability time and appropriateness in general simple investigations which rapidly give the diagnosis or clues to it are all that are needed these include electrocardiogram ecgs arterial blood gas abg and plain xrays it is relatively unusual to have to wait for the results of investigations such as full blood count fbc urea electrolytes ue and liver function tests lfts before referring a patient since these rarely alter the immediate management simple trolley side investigations are often of great value for example stix estimations of blood glucose bmg and urinalysis if complicated investigations are needed then referral for inpatient or outpatient specialist care is often required has the patient had appropriate treatment pending the admission do not forget or delay analgesia treat every patient in pain appropriately as soon as possible a patient does not have to earn analgesia never delay analgesia to allow further examination or investigation concern regarding masking of signs or symptoms for example in a patient with an acute abdomen is inhumane and incorrect wwwketabpezeshkicom discharge referral and handover how to refer patients referral is often by telephone and this can create problems introduce yourself and ask for the name and grade of the specialist give a clear concise summary of the history investigations and treatment that you have already undertaken early in the discussion say clearly whether you are making a referral for admission or a request for a specialist opinion with ever increasing pressure on hospital beds inpatient teams can be reluctant to come and see patients and may appear to be happier to give advice over the phone to avoid admission if in your view the patient needs to be admitted then clearly indicate this if for whatever reason this is declined do not get cross rude or aggressive but contact senior ed medical staff to speak to the specialist team when the specialist team comes to see the patient or the patient is admitted directly to a ward the ed notes need to be complete and legible make sure that there is a list of the investigations already performed together with the available results and crucially a list of investigations whose results remain outstanding the latter is essential to ensure continuity of care and to prevent an important result falling through the net similarly summarize treatment already given and the response in an emergency do not delay referral or treatment merely to complete the notes but complete them at the earliest opportunity encourage inpatient specialists who attend patients to write their ﬁ ndings and management plan in the notes adding a signature and the timedate handing over patients dangers of handing over handing over a patient to a colleague because your shift has ended and you are going home is fraught with danger it is easy for patients to be neglected or receive suboptimal or delayed treatment it is safest to complete to the point of discharge or referral to an inpatient team every patient that you are seeing at the end of a shift occasionally this may not be possible eg if there is a delay in obtaining an xray or other investigation in these situations hand over the patient carefully to the doctor who is taking over and inform the nursing staff of this how to hand over include in the handover relevant aspects of history and examination performed the investigation results and the treatment undertaken sign and aim to complete records on the patient as soon as possible note the time of hand over and the name of the doctor or nurse handed over to when accepting a handedover patient at the start of a shift spend time establishing exactly what has happened so far finally it is courteous and will prevent problems to tell the patient that their further care will be performed by another doctor or nurse wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach liaising with gps despite changes in the way that care particularly out of hours is delivered gps still have a pivotal role in coordinating medical care often the gp will know more than anyone about the past history social and family situation and recent events of their patients management therefore contact the gp when these aspects are relevant to the patients ed attendance or where considerations of admission or discharge are concerned every attendance is followed routinely by a letter to the gp detailing the reasons for presentation clinical ﬁ ndings and relevant investigations treatment given and followup arrangements if a patient dies contact the gp without delay to provide a medical contact and assistance to the bereaved family to prevent embarrassing experiences eg letters requesting clinic attendances and out of courtesy because the gp is the patients primary medical attendant finally the gp may be asked to issue a death certiﬁ cate by the coroner in scotland the procurator fiscal following further enquiries always contact the gp prior to the discharge of a patient where early followup ie within the next hr is required this may occur with elderly patients where there is uncertainty about the home situation and their ability to manage a typical example is an elderly lady with a colles fracture of her dominant wrist who lives alone the ed management of this patient is relatively simple b p however merely manipulating a colles fracture into a good position supporting it in an adequate cast and providing analgesia is only one facet of care the gp may know that the lady has supportive relatives or neighbours who will help with shopping and cooking and will help her to bath and dress the gp and the primary care team may be able to supplement existing support and check that the patient is coping equally the gp may indicate that with additional home support eg home helps meals district nurses the patient could manage alternatively the gp may indicate that the colles fracture merely represents the ﬁ nal event in an increasingly fragile home situation and that the patient will require hospital admission at least in the shortterm for the same reasons a gp who refers a patient to the ed and indicates that the patient requires admission does so in the full knowledge of that patients circumstances always contact the gp if it is contemplated that the patient is to be discharged preferably after senior medical consultation finally remember that gps are also under considerable pressure some situations may appear to reﬂ ect the fact that a patient has been referred inappropriately or the patient may report that they have tried to contact their gp unsuccessfully rather than irately ringing the practice and antagonizing them inform the ed consultant who can raise this constructively and appropriately in a suitable environment wwwketabpezeshkicom telephone advice telephone advice many departments receive calls from patients parents and other carers for advice approach these calls in exactly the same way as a facetoface consultation formally document details of the call including date and time of the call the callers telephone number the callers relationship to the patient the patients name age and sex the nature of the problem the advice given as with all notes date time and sign these notes nhs direct in england and wales nhs direct provides a hr day a week telephone service providing information and advice on health matters it is staffed by nurses who respond according to protocols the telephone number for nhs direct is the equivalent service in scotland is nhs tel these services have internet websites at wwwnhsdirectnhsuk and wwwnhscom telephone advice calls from other health professionals occasionally other health professionals request advice regarding the management of patients in their care such advice should be given by experienced ed staff telemedicine increasingly emergency health care is provided by integrated networks which include eds minor injuries units radiology departments and gp surgeries connected by telemedicine links this has advantages in remote or rural settings enabling a wide range of injuries and other emergencies to be diagnosed and treated locally the combination of video and teleradiology may allow a decision to be made and explained directly to the patient a typical example is whether a patient with an isolated colles fracture needs to have a manipulation of the fracture expertise is required to undertake telemedicine consultations safely this specialist advice should be given by senior ed staff and careful documentation is crucial wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach liaising with the ambulance crew paramedics and ed staff have a close professional relationship paramedics and ambulance staff are professionals who work in conditions that are often difﬁ cult and sometimes dangerous it is worth taking an offduty day to accompany a crew during their shift to see the problems they face a beneﬁ t of paramedic training has been to bring ambulance staff into the ed to work with medical and nursing staff and to foster the communication and rapport essential for good patient management in the uk a patient brought to an ed by ambulance will routinely have a patient report form prf see fig this is completed by the crew at the scene and in transit and given to reception or nursing staff on arrival the information on these forms can be invaluable in particular the time intervals between the receipt of the call and arrival at the scene and at hospital provide a time framework within which changes in the patients clinical condition can be placed and interpreted the initial atscene assessment will include details of the use of seat belts

assessments of illness or injury severity or to perform otherwise simple tasks eg airway management and intravenous iv cannulation do not dismiss the overall assessment of a patient made by an experienced crew while the ultimate diagnosis may not be clear a situation which pertains equally in the ed their evaluation of the potential for life threatening events is often extremely perceptive equally take heed of their description of crash scenes they will have seen far more than most ed staff so accept their greater experience most ambulance staff are keen to obtain feedback both about speciﬁ c cases and general aspects of medical care like everyone they are interested in their patients a few words as to what happened to mrs smith who was brought in last week and her subsequent clinical course is a friendly and easy way of providing informal feedback and helps to cement the professional relationship between the ambulance service and the ed wwwketabpezeshkicom liaising with

although many junior doctors coming to the ed have completed more than months of work since qualiﬁ cation the prospect of working at the sharp end can be accompanied by trepidation as with many potentially worrying situations in life reality is not as terrifying as its anticipation the number of hours worked may not appear long in comparison with other posts but do not assume that this makes an ed job easy being on duty inevitably involves much time standing walking working thinking and making decisions it is unusual to come offshift without feeling physically tired active young doctors can usually cope with these physical demands but a demanding professional life and demanding social life are rarely compatible make the most of time off and try to relax from the pressures of the job one function of relaxation is to enable you to face work refreshed and invigorated you are mistaken if you believe that you can stay out all night and then work unimpaired the next day tired doctors make mistakes they also tend to have less patience and as a consequence interpersonal conﬂ icts are more likely a greater problem is the mental aspect of the job doctors often ﬁ nd that the ed is the ﬁ rst time in their careers when they have to make unequiv ocal decisions based on their own assessment and investigations this is one of the great challenges and excitements of emergency medicine it is also a worry decisionmaking is central to ed practice and with experi ence the process becomes easier developing a structured approach can preempt many problems and simplify your life after taking an appropriate history and completing the relevant clinical examination of a patient ask yourself a series of questions such as do i know what is likely to be wrong with this patient what investigations are required to conﬁ rm the diagnosis do i know what treatment is needed and have i got the skills needed does this patient require referral to an inpatient team b p if not do they need to be reviewed in the ed or another specialist clinic the wide spectrum of problems with which ed patients can present means that no individual can be expert in every possible condition it is therefore as important to recognize and accept when you are out of your depth as it is to make decisions and treat patients whom you know you can manage seek help appropriately and do not just try to muddle through help may be readily available from senior ed staff but in some departments direct contact with a specialist team is required one of the most difﬁ cult situations is where a specialist either refuses to come to see the patient or gives telephone advice that is clearly inappropriate you must always act as the patients advocate if you refer a patient with a fractured neck of femur and the telephone message from the inpatient team is bring him back to the fracture clinic in one week it is clearly wrong to carry this out first check that the doctor has understood the details of the patients condition and your concerns more conﬂ ict and aggravation is caused by communication errors usually involving second hand telephone messages than by anything else if the situation remains unresolved consult senior ed staff whatever happens never lose your cool in public and always put your patients interests ﬁ rst wwwketabpezeshkicom coping as a junior doctor learning in the ed try to learn something new every day keep a note of patients with interesting or unusual problems and later check what happened to them ask senior staff for advice use the ed reference books try to note all new conditions seen during a shift and read about them later staff interaction the nature of the job the patients and the diversity of staff involved means that a considerable degree of camaraderie exists for an outsider this can initially be daunting junior medical staff are likely to work for months in the department other staff may have spent a lifetime there with longestablished friendships or sometimes animosities respect their position and experience learn from them the nub of this is an understanding that the role of one individual and that of other individuals in the department are inextricably linked any junior or senior doctor who feels that they are the most important individual in their working environment will have an extremely uncomfortable professional existence in the ed every member of staff has a role your professionalism should dictate that you respect this only in this way will you gain reciprocal respect from other staff members never consider any job beneath you or someone elses responsibility patients come before pride so if portering staff are rushed off their feet and you are unoccupied wheel a patient to xray yourself it will improve your standing with your colleagues and help the patient shifts rule never be late for your shift rule if for whatever reason you are unable to work a shift let the senior staff in the ed know as soon as possible ensure that you take a break two or three short breaks in an hr shift are better than one long one remember to eat and maintain your ﬂ uid intake shift working may mean that you will work sometimes with familiar faces and perhaps occasionally with individuals with whom you ﬁ nd social contact uncomfortable put these considerations aside while you are at work for the sake of the patients and your peace of mind if you cant cope finally if you feel that you are unable to manage or that the pressure of the job is too great tell someone dont bottle it up try to ignore it or assume that it reﬂ ects inadequacy it doesnt everyone at some time has feelings of inability to cope trying to disguise or deny the situation is unfair to yourself your colleagues and your patients you need to tell someone and discuss things do it now talk to your consultant if you cannot face him or her talk to your gp or another senior member of staff but talk to someone who can help you the bma counselling service for doctors tel provides a conﬁ dential counselling service hr a day days of the year to discuss personal emotional and workrelated problems the doctors support network wwwdsnorguk and doctors support line tel are also useful resources wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach inappropriate attenders this is an emotive and illdeﬁ ned term depending upon the department such patients could comprise of attendances the perception as to whether it is appropriate to go to an ed or attend a gp will vary between the patient gp and ed staff appropriateness is not simply related to the symptoms diagnosis or the time interval involved it may not necessarily be related to the need for investigation for example not all patients who require an xray necessarily have to attend an ed further blurring of appropriate and inappropriate groups relates to the geographical location of the ed in rural areas gps frequently perform procedures such as suturing in urban areas these arrangements are less common for illdeﬁ ned reasons patients often perceive that they should only contact their gp during ofﬁ ce hours and outside these times may attend an ed with primary care complaints it is clearly inappropriate to come to an ed simply because of a real or perceived difﬁ culty in accessing primary care nevertheless the term inappropriate attendance is a pejorative one it is better to use the phrase primary care patients it must be recognized that primary care problems are best dealt with by gps many departments try to prevent this primary care workload presenting to the ed some departments tackle the problem by having gps working alongside ed staff managing inappropriate attenders only through a continual process of patient education will these problems be resolved initiatives include nurse practitioner minor injury units and hospitalbased primary care services evaluations are underway but to function effectively such services require adequate funding and stafﬁ ng it can sometimes be difﬁ cult to deal with primary care problems in the ed after an appropriate history and examination it may be necessary to explain to patients that they will have to attend their own gp this may need direct contact between the ed and the practice to facilitate this inappropriate referrals sometimes it may appear that another health professional eg gp emergency nurse practitioner nurse at nhs direct has referred a patient to the ed inappropriately avoid making such judgements treat patients on their merits but mention the issue to your consultant remember that the information available to the referring clinician at the time of the prehospital consultation is likely to have been different to that available at the time of ed attendance wwwketabpezeshkicom the patient with a label the patient with a label some patients will have been referred by another medical practitioner usually a gp the accompanying letter may include a presumptive diagnosis the details in the letter are often extremely helpful but do not assume the diagnosis is necessarily correct take particular care with patients who reattend following an earlier attendance the situation may have changed since the previous doctor saw the patient clinical signs may have developed or regressed the patient may have not given the referring doctor and ed staff the same history do not prejudge the problem start with an open mind apply common sense however keep any previous history in mind for example assume that a patient with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm who collapses with sudden severe abdominal pain signs of hypovolaemic shock and a tender pulsatile mass in the abdomen to have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm rather than intestinal obstruction the patients previous ed and hospital case notes are invaluable and will often give useful information and allow for example ecg comparisons aiding the diagnostic process a call to the gp can also provide useful background which they may not have had time to include in their referral letter or may have excluded for conﬁ dentiality or other reasons selflabelled patients take care with patients who label themselves those with chronic or unusual diseases often know signiﬁ cantly more about their conditions than ed staff in such situations take special notice of comments and advice from the patient andor their relatives do not resent this or see it as a professional affront rapport with the patient will increase markedly and management will usually be easier regular attenders every ed has a group of regular patients who with time become physically and sometimes emotionally attached to the department some have underlying psychiatric illnesses often with inadequate personalities some are homeless regular attenders frequently use the ed as a source of primary care as outlined above make attempts to direct them to appropriate facilities because the ed is unsuited to the management of chronic illness and is unable to provide the continuing medical and nursing support that these patients require repeated presentations with apparently trivial complaints or with the same complaint often tax the patience of ed staff this is heightened if the presentations are provoked or aggravated by alcohol intake remember however that these patients can and do suffer from the same acute events as everyone else keep an open mind diagnostically and in attitude to the patient just because heshe has returned for the third time in as many days complaining of chest pain does not mean that on this occasion he does not have an acute mi maintain adequate documentation for each attendance occasionally especially with intractable reattenders a joint meeting between the social work team gp ed consultant and psychiatric services is required to provide a deﬁ nitive framework for both the patient and the medical services for some patients it will be possible to follow a plan of action for ed presentations with a particular complaint wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach the patient you dislike general approach accept the patient as he or she is regardless of behaviour class religion social lifestyle or colour given human nature there will inevitably be some patients whom you immediately dislike or ﬁ nd difﬁ cult the feeling is often mutual many factors that cause patients to present to the ed may aggravate the situation these include their current medical condition their past experiences in hospitals their social situation and any concurrent use of alcohol andor other drugs your approach and state of mind during the consultation play a major role this will be inﬂ uenced by whether the department is busy how much sleep you have had recently and when you last had a break for coffee or food given the nature of ed workload and turnover conﬂ ict slows down the process and makes it more likely that you will make clinical errors many potential conﬂ icts can be avoided by an open pleasant approach introduce yourself politely to the patient use body language to reduce a potentially aggressive response the patients perspective put yourself in the patients position any patient marched up to by a doctor who has their hands on hips a glaring expression and the demand well whats wrong with you now will retort aggressively defusing a volatile situation most complaints and aggression occur when the department is busy and waiting times are long patients understand the pressures medical and nursing staff have to work under and a simple i am sorry you have had to wait so long but we have had a number of emergencies elsewhere in the department does much to diffuse potential conﬂ ict and will often mean that the patient starts to sympathize with you as a young overworked practitioner there is never any excuse for rude abusive or aggressive behaviour to a patient if you are rude complaints will invariably follow and more importantly the patient will not have received the appropriate treatment for their condition it may be necessary to hand care of a patient to a colleague if an unresolvable conﬂ ict has arisen management of the violent patient is considered in detail on b p wwwketabpezeshkicom special patient groups special patient groups attending the ed is difﬁ cult enough but can be even more so for certain special patient groups it is important that ed staff are sensitive to the needs of these groups and that there are systems in place to help them in what may be regarded as an intimidating atmosphere the following list is far from exhaustive but includes some important groups who require particular consideration children they are such an obvious and large minority group that they receive special attention to suit their particular needs see b paediatric emergencies p pregnant women see b obstetrics and gynaecology p those with mental health problems see b psychiatry p the elderly who often have multiple medical problems and live in socially precarious circumstances patients with alzheimers disease and other states associated with chronic confusion those with learning difﬁ culties b p patients with hearing problems the visually impaired those who do not speak or understand english arrangements should be in place to enable the use of interpreters patients with certain cultural or religious beliefs particularly amongst minority groups these can impact signiﬁ cantly upon a variety of situations eg after unsuccessful resuscitation for cardiac arrest b breaking bad news p those who are homeless or are away from home friends and family eg holiday makers those who have drugalcohol dependency isnt everyone special taken at face value the concept that certain groups of patients are special and so require special attention does not meet with universal approval there is a good argument that every patient deserves the best possible care whilst this is true it is also obvious that certain patients do have additional needs that need to be considered many of these additional needs relate to effective communication there are some tremendous resources available that can help practitioners to overcome communication difﬁ culties eg wwwcommunicationpeoplecouk wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach discharging the elderly patient there are no set predisposing factors that determine patients most at risk following discharge those that affect the chance of difﬁ culties at home include the current medical problem underlying functional and social factors risk indicators multiple pathologies and atypical symptoms render this group more vulnerable to the physical functional and social effects of acute illness past medical history and preadmission status are especially important determinants for patients with dementia or psychiatric illness there may be evidence of recently changed circumstances a recent bereavement a change in medical or physical condition increasing confusion or unusual behaviour the patient may not be able to afford adequate food or heating community services may not be aware that support is needed or help may have been offered but refused other important indicators are those living alone absence of close family support or community services unsuitable home circumstances eg external or internal stairs difﬁ culty with mobility determining those unable to cope look for evidence of selfneglect that suggests that the elderly person is having difﬁ culty coping at home eg poor personal hygiene unclean or unsuitable clothing evidence of recent weight loss may suggest difﬁ culties with food preparation or eating unavailability of food or may be due to serious pathology such as a malignancy or tuberculosis signs of old bruising or other minor injuries may be consistent with frequent falls shortness of breath and any condition producing impaired mobility are important factors falls are a common problem of old age and require careful analysis perhaps at a special falls clinic correctable factors include damaged walking aids loose rugs poor lighting or unsuitable footwear or glasses common medical causes include cerebrovascular disease arthritis and sideeffects of drugs many elderly people claim that they can cope at home when they are unable to do so if in doubt ask relatives the gp and community support agencies they may give helpful insight into the patients mental state which can be investigatedassessed further whether it be a cognitive or reactive condition the decision to discharge hospital admission for an elderly person is a frightening experience and can lead to confusion and disorientation if circumstances allow discharge home is often a more appropriate outcome if there are concerns regarding their functional ability and mobility ask for an occupational therapy and or physiotherapy assessment with if appropriate a home assessment the elderly person is best seen in their home environment with familiar surroundings especially if there is evidence of cognitive deﬁ cit the provision of equipment and recommendations for adaptations can be made at this point if required a wide range of community services including district nurse health visitor home help crisis care social work hospital discharge and rapid response therapy teams can be contacted to provide immediate followup and support and play a crucial role in preventing later breakdowns in home circumstances and unnecessary admissions for social reasons wwwketabpezeshkicom the patient with learning difficulties the patient with learning difﬁ culties patients with learning difﬁ culties use the healthcare system more than the general population unfortunately many healthcare professionals have little experience with these patients however understanding common illness patterns and using different techniques in communication can result in a successful consultation patients with learning difﬁ culties often have complex health needs there are many barriers to assessing health care which may lead to later presentations of illness patients may have a high tolerance of pain take this into consideration when examining them associated health problems patients with learning difﬁ culties have a higher incidence of certain problems visual and hearing impairment poor dental health swallowing problems gastrooesophageal reﬂ ux disease constipation urinary tract and other infections epilepsy mental health problems i incidence of depression anxiety disorders schizophrenia delirium and dementia with speciﬁ c syndromes having their own particular associations eg downs is associated with depression and dementia praderwilli with affective psychosis behavioural problems eg praderwilli angelman syndrome leading causes of death these include pneumonia relating to reﬂ ux aspiration swallowing and feeding problems and congenital heart disease the patients perspective past experiences of hospital are likely to have a big impact on the patients reaction to hisher current situation most patients have problems with expression comprehension and social communication they ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to describe symptoms behavioural change may the best indication that something is wrong tips for communication explain the consultation process before starting speak ﬁ rst to the patient then to the carer use open questions then rephrase to check again aim to use language that the patient understands modifying this according to comprehension patients may have difﬁ culties with time so try to relate symptoms to real life temporal events eg did the pain start before lunch they may not make a connection between something that they have done and feeling ill eg several questions may be required in order to establish that they have ingested something take particular note of what the carer has to say information from someone who knows the patient well is invaluable wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach patient transfer the need to transfer when patients have problems that exceed the capabilities of a hospital andor its personnel transfer to another hospital may be needed timing the transfer do not commence any transfer until lifethreatening problems have been identiﬁ ed and managed and a secondary survey has been completed once the decision to transfer has been made do not waste time performing nonessential diagnostic procedures that do not change the immediate plan of care first secure the airway with tracheal intubation if necessary ensure that patients with pneumothoraces and chest injuries likely to be associated with pneumothoraces have intercostal drains inserted prior to transfer this is particularly important before sending a patient by helicopter or ﬁ xed wing transfer consider the need to insert a urinary catheter and a gastric tube arranging the transfer speak directly to the doctor at the receiving hospital provide the following details by telephone or telemedicine link details of the patient full name age and date of birth a brief history of the onset of symptomsinjury the prehospital ﬁ ndings and treatment the initial ﬁ ndings diagnosis and treatment in the ed and the response to treatment write down the name of the doctor responsible for the initial reception of the patient after transfer establish precisely where within the receiving hospital the patient is to be taken where possible prepare the receiving unit by sending details ahead by faxemail preprinted forms can help in structuring the relevant details and avoiding omissions preparing for transfer transfer team if the patient to be transferred may require advanced airway care ensure they are accompanied by a doctor who can provide this the accompanying nurse should be trained in resuscitation with a good knowledge of the equipment used during transfer equipment transfer cases containing a standardized list of equipment must be immediately available and regularly checked take all the emergency equipment and drugs that might prove necessary to maintain the airway breathing and circulation abc during transfer in particular take at least twice the amount of o estimated to be necessary a standard f cylinder contains l of o and will therefore last hr running at l min before leaving ensure that the patient and stretcher are wellsecured within the ambulance send all crossmatched blood in a suitably insulated container with the patient wwwketabpezeshkicom patient transfer monitoring during transfer minimum monitoring during transfer includes ecg monitoring pulse oximetry and noninvasive bp measurement if the patient is intubated and ventilated endtidal carbon dioxide co monitoring is mandatory an intraarterial line is recommended to monitor bp during the journey make allowances for limited battery life on long transfers spare batteries may be needed plug monitors and other equipment into the mains supply whenever possible accompanying documentation include the following patient details name date of birth address next of kin telephone numbers hospital number gp history examination ﬁ ndings and results of investigations including xray ﬁ lms type and volume of all ﬂ uids infused including prehospital management including drugs given type route and time of administration practical procedures performed response to treatment including serial measurements of vital signs name of referring and receiving doctors their hospitals and telephone numbers some departments use standard forms to ensure that important information is complete the relatives keep the patients relatives informed throughout explain where and why the patient is going document what they have been told arrange transport for relatives to the receiving hospital before leaving prior to transfer reexamine the patient check that the airway is protected ventilation is satisfactory chest drains are working iv cannulae patent and well secured and that the spine is appropriately immobilized but pressure areas protected ensure that the patient is wellcovered to prevent heat loss inform the receiving hospital when the patient has left and give an estimated time of arrival after leaving communicate to the receiving hospital the results of any investigations that become available after the patient has left contact the receiving doctor afterwards to conﬁ rm that the transfer was completed satisfactorily and to obtain feedback intrahospital transfers in many respects the only difference between intra and interhospital transfers is the distance the principles involved in organizing a transfer are the same whether the patient is to be conveyed to the computed tomography ct scanner down the corridor or to the regional neurosurgical unit miles away wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach breaking bad news a proportion of patients presenting to the ed have lifethreatening conditions and some will die in the department often the event will be sudden and unexpected by family and friends it may already involve other family members eg in the context of a road trafﬁ c collision in contrast to hospital inpatients or those in general practice an opportunity to forewarn relatives as to what has happened or the eventual outcome is unlikely the relatives may already be distressed after witnessing the incident or collapse and may have been directly involved in providing ﬁ rst aid it is inappropriate for junior hospital staff without suitable experience to speak with distressed or bereaved relatives the task must be undertaken by someone with sufﬁ cient seniority and authority who also has the skills of communication and empathy the most important component is time reception relatives usually arrive separately and after the patient anticipate this by designating a member of staff to meet them and show them to a relatives room which should afford privacy comfortable seating an outside telephone line tea coffee and toilet facilities paper tissues some magazines and toys for small children are useful while the relatives are waiting a designated nurse should stay with them to act as a link with the department and the team caring for the patient this nurse can prewarn relatives of the lifethreatening nature of the patients condition and assist in building an albeit short relationship between staff and relatives the link nurse should also check that important details have been recorded correctly eg the patients name address date of birth religion in case last rites are required next of kin name relationship to patient address and phone no and the patients gp this information should be collected as soon as possible since later the relatives may be too upset to remember all these details or it may be difﬁ cult to ask for them breaking the news irrespective of who performs this task remember a number of points if you are the person who informs the relatives ensure the link nurse is with you after leaving the resuscitation room or clinical area allow a minute or two of preparation to make yourself presentable checking clothing for bloodstains etc conﬁ rm that you know the patients name enter the room introduce yourself and sit or kneel by the relatives so that you are at their physical level ensure that you speak with the correct relatives and identify who is who speak slowly keep your sentences short and non technical do not hedge around the subject in their emotional turmoil relatives very often misconstrue information therefore you may need to reemphasize the important aspects for many critically ill patients their ultimate prognosis cannot be deter mined in the ed in these situations do not raise unrealistic expectations or false hopes but be honest and direct with the relatives and the patients wwwketabpezeshkicom breaking bad news if the patient has died then use the words death or dead do not use euphemisms such as passed away or gone to a better place after giving the news allow relatives a few minutes to collect their thoughts and ask questions in some cases these may be unanswerable it is better to say we dont yet know rather than confuse or give platitudinous answers common responses to bad news or bereavement include emotional distress denial guilt and aggression the feelings of guilt and anger can be particularly difﬁ cult to come to terms with and relatives may torture themselves with the idea that if only their actions had been different the situation would never have arisen or the clinical outcome would have been different relatives seeing patients many relatives wish to see or touch their loved ones however brieﬂ y television and cinema have prepared much of the population for the sights and sounds in the ed in some departments relatives are encouraged to be present in the resuscitation room in selected situations the stratagem has beneﬁ ts if the relatives are present during resuscitation it is essential that the link nurse is present with the relatives to provide support explain what is happening and accompany them if they wish to leave more frequently the relatives can see the patient in the resuscitation room brieﬂ y or while they are leaving the ed eg to go to ct scan room or theatre even a few seconds a few words and a cuddle can be immensely rewarding for both relative and patient the link nurse can give guidance beforehand as to the presence of injuries especially those involving the face monitors drips and equipment to diminish any threatening impact that these may have when death occurs even before death has occurred involvement of religious leaders is valuable as early as possible inform the hospital chaplain who can provide invaluable help to relatives and staff when a patient has died offer the relatives the opportunity to see the body this contact which should be in a private quiet room can greatly assist in the grieving process with careful preparation most patients who have died from multiple injuries can be seen by relatives in this fashion remember that followers of some faiths such as muslims and hindus have important procedures and rituals to be followed after death although these may not always be feasible after a sudden death especially from trauma in such situations discuss the matter with the coroners or procurator fiscals ofﬁ cer and obtain help from an appropriate religious leader to look after the bereaved relatives wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter general approach what to do after a death who to contact any suspicious death must be immediately reported to the police who will liaise directly with the coroner or procurator fiscal in scotland following all deaths in the ed a number of important contacts must be made as soon as possible informing the next of kin if the relatives are not already present in ed it may be necessary to ask the police for assistance notifying the coroner procurator fiscal in scotland informing the patients gp cancelling hospital outpatient appointments informing social work and health visitor teams as appropriate ensure deceaseds relatives are given information about the process for death certiﬁ cation and registration and how to organize funeral arrangements most eds have useful leaﬂ ets that cover these matters and can answer many questions some departments have formal arrangements for counselling after bereavement often the gp is the best individual to coordinate bereavement care but in any event give the relatives a telephone number for the ed so they can speak to a senior nurse or doctor if they need further information or help information for the coroner or procurator fiscal report sudden deaths as soon as possible to the coroner in scotland the procurator fiscal it is helpful to give the following information if it is available patients name address date of birth next of kin name relationship address phone no patients gp date and time of patients arrival in the ed date and time of patients death name and job title of doctor who pronounced death details of the incident injuries or illness relevant past medical history when the patient last saw a doctor the coroner may be happy for a gp or hospital doctor to write a death certiﬁ cate if they saw the patient recently for the condition that caused death eg a patient with known terminal cancer the patients religion some faiths may wish to arrange burial before the next sunset but this may not be feasible after a sudden death anything else that is important eg difﬁ culties in communication with the next of kin due to language or deafness wwwketabpezeshkicom what to do after a death looking after the staff the death of a patient or the management of patients with critical illness inevitably affects the ed staff this is particularly so when some aspect of the event reminds staff of their own situation or relatives these episodes often occur at the busiest times and when everyone in the ed is working under pressure one of the most difﬁ cult situations is to have to inform parents of the death of their child and help them in the initial grieving process and then return to the busy department where many people are waiting with increasingly strident demands it would be easy to respond that such individuals with injuries or illnesses that are minor or present for days or weeks are timewasting however this approach will lead to conﬂ ict and is unfair to all concerned instead take min for a break in the staff room before returning to the fray remember that in these circumstances you too are a patient even senior and experienced staff may be distressed after difﬁ cult resuscitation situations and may require support organ donation there is considerable potential to assist with the process of organtissue donation in the ed however the possibility of organ donation is sadly often overlooked in the ed many patients who die after unexpected cardiac arrest are potential donors of corneal tissue and heart valves kidneys may also be retrieved from some patients who have died in the ed if a protocol for this has been arranged with the transplant team and the local coroner or procurator fiscal many other patients who are moribund intubated and ventilated eg following massive subarachnoid haemorrhage may be identiﬁ ed as potential donors of other tissues also consider the possibility of organ donation in patients who die in the ed or who are moribund with no hope of survival most hospitals have specialist organ donation nurses previously known as donor transplant coordinators who will educate advise and assist with the process of organ donation useful information about organtissue transplantation is available on the website of the british transplantation society wwwbts orguk

hands before and after every patient contact and after any activity that might contaminate hands including removing gloves hands that are visibly dirty or possibly grossly contaminated must be washed with soap and water and dried thoroughly alcohol hand gel can be used if the hands look clean cover broken skin with a waterproof dressing personal protective equipment ppe wear suitable disposable gloves for any contact with blood body ﬂ uids mucous membranes or non intact skin latex gloves are widely used but cause allergic reactions in some patients and staff who need special nitrile gloves use a disposable plastic apron if there is a risk of blood or body ﬂ uids contaminating clothing after use dispose of it and wash your hands impervious gowns are needed if there is a high risk of contamination use a mask face shield and eye protection if blood or body ﬂ uids might splash in your eyes or mouth protection against respiratory viruses eg sars or inﬂ uenza requires special masks or respirators eg ffp which must be ﬁ tted and used properly powered airpurifying respirators should be used for highrisk procedures such as intubating patients with serious viral infections safe handling and disposal of sharps avoid handling needles directly or using handheld needles never resheathe needles place used needles and blades immediately into a sharps bin if possible use safety

staff detailing their duties all staff need to familiarize themselves with their roles in advance callin lists must be up to date and available at all times major incident practices must be held regularly to check arrangements and contact details and to remind staff what they should do alert the ambulance service or the police should warn the hospital of a possible or deﬁ nite major incident initial messages are often inaccurate because they are based on confused and incomplete information from the scene occasionally patients arrive without warning from a major incident near the hospital ensure that the ed consultant on duty is informed immediately of any suspected major incident enabling them to participate in the decision to start the major incident procedure senior medical nursing and administrative staff will set up the hospitals control centre and prepare for action if the major incident is conﬁ rmed the full hospital response is initiated following the procedures in the plan

porters call in other ed staff in accordance with the major incident plan clear the ed of any patients who are not seriously ill or injured prepare the department to receive patients from the incident doctors and nurses arriving to help should be given appropriate action cards staff should have labels or tabards so that ed staff and other specialties eg anaesthetists can be identiﬁ ed easily prepare a triage point at the ambulance entrance this should be staffed by a senior doctor and nurse who direct patients to the most appropriate area of the department if possible a nurse should stay with each patient until heshe is discharged or admitted to a ward all patients should be labelled immediately with a unique major incident number which is used on all notes forms blood samples property bags and lists of patients collect names addresses and other details as soon as possible but this must not delay triage or emergency treatment keep lists of anyone leaving the ed ensure that the hospital control centre is regularly updated regarding the situation in the ed wwwketabpezeshkicom major incidents wards and theatres beds must be cleared to receive patients preferably on or

chapter toxicology reducing absorption of poison background information if a poison has been swallowed it is logical to try to remove it and reduce absorption from the gut possible measures include gastric lavage induced emesis eg with ipecacuanha oral adsorbents especially activated charcoal and wholebowel irrigation none of these can be recom mended routinely they may cause signiﬁ cant morbidity and there is very little evidence that they improve outcomes gastric lavage this does not empty the stomach of solids and may force gastric contents through the pylorus into the small bowel it may cause hypoxia aspiration pneumonia and occasionally oesophageal perforation gastric lavage hr after overdose is ineffective in d absorption of poisons gastric lavage does not reduce mortality from poisoning and it does not deter patients from taking repeated overdoses practical advice on use of gastric lavage only consider this if the patient has taken a lifethreatening amount of poison within the previous hour or is deeply unconscious because of poisoning only consider performing it if there is a strong cough reﬂ ex or the airway is protected by a cuffed et tube do not use lavage for poisoning with corrosives risk of perforation or with petrolparafﬁ n compounds risk of pneumonitis except rarely in severe poisoning on specialist advice before starting gastric lavage check that

tube or french gaugefg and pass it through the mouth into the stomach conﬁ rm position by aspirating gastric contents or blowing air down the tube while listening over the stomach aspirate gastric contents and keep labelled sample for later analysis if necessary perform lavage by pouring ml aliquots of tepid tap water down the tube and siphoning it back while massaging over stomach to help dislodge tablet debris continue until the efﬂ uent is clear consider leaving activated charcoal g in the stomach while withdrawing the tube occlude it between the ﬁ ngers to prevent aspiration of ﬂ

within hr this d absorption of therapeutic doses of many drugs but there is little evidence of clinical beneﬁ t after overdose charcoal d the halflife of some drugs eg digoxin which undergo enterohepatic recycling however charcoal is messy unpleasant to take and often causes vomiting aspiration into the lungs can result in fatal pneumonitis various formulations of activated charcoal are available actidose aqua advance is less unpalatable than some of the other formulations carbomix may cause severe constipation especially if given in repeated doses do not give activated charcoal for substances which do not bind to it these include iron lithium boric acid cyanide ethanol ethylene glycol methanol organophosphates petroleum distillates and strong acids and alkalis charcoal is most likely to be useful for poisons which are toxic in small quantities eg tricyclic antidepressants and theophylline derivatives if a dangerous overdose has been taken in the previous hr give charcoal po

obtain expert advice before giving charcoal in repeated doses which are only helpful in lifethreatening poisoning with a few drugs eg carbamazepine dapsone digoxin phenobarbital quinine theophylline and salicylate and a few other drugs rarely taken in overdose wholebowel irrigation wholebowel irrigation is rarely needed and should only be used on expert advice the aim of wholebowel irrigation is to empty the bowel rapidly of solid contents by giving ﬂ uid down a nasogastric ng tube until the rectal efﬂ uent becomes clear the value of this is uncertain it may be useful for poisoning with sustainedrelease drug formulations or for poisons such as iron or lithium which are not absorbed by activated charcoal it has also been used to remove packets of cocaine from body packers and button batteries from children bowel cleansing solutions of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes eg kleanprep should be used for wholebowel irrigation lhr in adults mlhr in small children for hr or occasionally longer do not use normal saline since it may cause ﬂ uid overload and hypokalaemia activated charcoal may be given by ng tube if appropriate before whole bowel irrigation is started

after some minutes or hours pralidoxime reactivates cholinesterase if given promptly before ageing occurs organophosphate nerve gas agents such as sarin may be released deliberately by terrorists information is available from toxbase b p carbamate insecticides act similarly to organophosphates but poisoning with carbamates is generally less severe and pralidoxime is not needed clinical features minor exposure to organophosphates may cause subclinical poisoning with d cholinesterase levels but no symptoms or signs symptoms may be delayed by hr after skin exposure early features of toxicity include anxiety restlessness insomnia tiredness headache nausea vomiting abdominal colic diarrhoea sweating hyper salivation and miosis muscle weakness and fasciculation may develop in severe poisoning there is widespread paralysis with respiratory failure pulmonary oedema profuse bronchial secretions bronchospasm convulsions and coma hyperglycaemia and cardiac arrhythmias may occur occasionally delayed effects of poisoning develop days after acute poisoning with cranial nerve palsies muscle weakness and respiratory failure which resolve after weeks a peripheral neuropathy may develop after weeks usually involving the legs management wear protective clothing and avoid getting contaminated yourself give supportive treatment as needed clear the airway and remove secretions

acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning lancet wwwketabpezeshkicom cyanide poisoning cyanide poisoning cyanide compounds are widely used in industry and may be ingested or inhaled inadvertently or deliberately cyanides produced by burning polyurethane foam i mortality from smoke inhalation if there is severe acidosis consider cyanide toxicity cyanide poisoning may be caused by the drug sodium nitroprusside or ingestion of amygdalin laetrile from the kernels of apricots cherries and other fruits solutions for removing artiﬁ cial ﬁ ngernails may contain acetonitrile methyl cyanide cyanides inhibit cytochrome oxidase blocking the tricarboxylic acid cycle and stopping cellular respiration this process is reversible inhalation of hydrogen cyanide often causes death within minutes ingestion of cyanides can produce rapid poisoning but food in the stomach may delay absorption and the onset of symptoms delayed poisoning may follow absorption of cyanides through the skin ingested cyanide compounds react with gastric acid to form hydrogen cyanide which could poison ﬁ rstaiders giving mouth to mouth resuscitation clinical features acute poisoning causes dizziness anxiety headache palpitations breath lessness and drowsiness in severe cases there may be coma convulsions paralysis pulmonary oedema cardiac arrhythmias and cardiorespiratory failure with metabolic acidosis most of the clinical features result from severe hypoxia but cyanosis is uncommon classically there is a smell of bitter almonds on the breath but many people cannot detect this management avoid getting contaminated yourself provide supportive measures give o and monitor ecg remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed skin consider activated charcoal or gastric lavage within hr of ingestion in mild poisoning reassurance o and observation may be all that is required exposure to cyanide causes great anxiety and it may be dif ﬁ cult to distinguish between fear of poisoning and early symptoms of toxicity speciﬁ c antidotes should be available but are not always needed some speciﬁ c antidotes to cyanide are dangerous in the absence of cyanide only give if poisoning is moderate or severe eg coma in severe cyanide poisoning give dicobalt edetate kelocyanor mg iv over min repeated if there is no improvement after min in the absence of cyanide dicobalt edetate may cause cobalt poisoning

squeeze may be precipitated by eustachian tube congestion and leads to erythema haemorrhage or tympanic membrane perforation with conductive hearing loss round or oval window rupture inner ear squeeze occurs with sudden pressure changes between the middle and inner ear and results in acute tinnitus vertigo and deafness and a perilymphatic ﬁ stula ent opinion is urgently required if a perilymphatic

never discharge a headinjured patient to go home alone admit patients with head injury and coexisting bleeding tendency including those taking anticoagulant drugs differential diagnosis consider whether another condition could be principally responsible for the patients symptoms for example small children who vomit after head injury may be suffering from otitis media or a throat infection

infection by disturbing the wound as little as possible prior to surgery orientation vertical horizontal or oblique contamination by dirt or other fbs may be obvious infection either localized or spreading is a feature of delayed presen tations and is associated in particular with certain speciﬁ c injuries eg reverse ﬁ ght bites see bite wounds neurological injury test and record motor and sensory components of relevant nerves be aware that complete nerve transection does not automatically result in complete loss of sensation some feeling is likely to be preserved particularly in the hand assume that any altered sen sation reﬂ ects nerve injury tendons complete division is usually apparent on testing partial tendon division is easily missed unless the wound is carefully examined the tendon may still be capable of performing its usual function look in the wound whilst moving the relevant joint and attempt to recreate the position of the injured part at the time of injury eg clenched ﬁ st to bring the injured structures into view vascular injury check for distal pulses depth wounds not fully penetrating the skin are superﬁ cial do not try to judge depth of other wounds before exploration in some circumstances eg neck wounds exploration is not appropriate in the ed type of wound inspection often allows wounds to be described helping to determine the mechanism of trauma blunt or sharp injury and hence the risk of associated injuries the crucial distinction is whether a wound was caused by a sharp or blunt instrument if in doubt avoid any descriptive term and simply call it a wound this avoids inaccuracy and courtroom embarrassment use the terms as described opposite wwwketabpezeshkicom the approach to wounds forensic classiﬁ cation of wounds and injury the expert forensic evaluation of injury is outside the remit of the ed specialist but a simple understanding helps to avoid incorrect use of terminology with associated confusion and sometimes embarrassment incised wounds may also be referred to as cuts caused by sharp injury eg knives or broken glass and characterized by cleancut edges these typically include stab wounds which are deeper than they are wide and slash wounds which are longer than they are deep lacerations caused by blunt injury eg impact of scalp against pavement or intact glass bottle the skin is torn resulting in irregular wound edges unlike most incised wounds tissues adjacent to laceration wound edges are also injured by crushing and will exhibit evidence of bruising puncture wounds most result from injury with sharp objects although a blunt object with sufﬁ cient force will also penetrate the skin abrasions commonly known as grazes these result from blunt injury applied tangentially abrasions are often ingrained with dirt with the risk of infection and in the longer term unwanted and unsightly skin tattooing skin tags visible at one end of the abrasion indicate the edge of skin last in contact with the abrading surface and imply the direction in which the skin was abraded burns see b p bruises bruising reﬂ ects blunt force crush injury to the blood vessels within the tissues resulting in tender swelling with discoloration sometimes localized bleeding collects to form a haematoma the term contusion is sometimes used as an alternative for bruise it has no particular special meaning or value record the site size colour and characteristic features of any bruising it is impossible to determine the exact age of a bruise from its colour however yellow colour within a bruise implies except in the neonate that it is hr old scratches these may comprise either a very superﬁ cial incision or a long thin abrasion leave the distinction to an expert interpersonal violence medicolegal implications victims of violence frequently attend ed for treatment of their injuries some patients particularly those who have suffered domestic violence may not provide an accurate account of how the injuries occurred and may not seek involvement of the police classical defence wounds include isolated ulna shaft fracture as the arm is raised to protect against blunt injury incised wounds on the palmar aspects of the palms and ﬁ ngers sustained in attempts to protect against knife attack in cases where the police are involved and where injuries are serious or extensive the police may arrange to obtain photographs and a forensic physician police surgeon may be involved in the role of documenting injuries most ed patients who have suffered violence do not see a forensic physician police surgeon therefore ed staff have a dual role of treating injuries and recording them accurately for medicolegal purposes wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter wounds fractures orthopaedics further assessment of skin wounds investigation xray if there is suspicion of fracture involvement of joint penetration of body cavity or fb specify on request forms that a fb is being sought to allow appropriate views and exposure most metal except aluminium and glass objects mm in diameter will show up on xray some objects eg wood may not uss may demonstrate these ct or mri are also occasionally helpful note xray all wounds from glass that fully penetrate the skin during xray use radioopaque markers eg paper clip taped to the skin to identify the area of concern wound swabs for bacteriology are unhelpful in fresh wounds but obtain them from older wounds showing signs of infection by far the most important investigation is wound exploration under appropriate anaesthesia allows full assessment and thorough cleaning of wounds that extend fully through the skin do not explore the following wounds in the ed stab wounds to the neck chest abdomen or perineum compound fracture wounds requiring surgery in theatre wounds over suspected septic joints or infected tendon sheaths most wounds with obvious neurovasculartendon injury needing repair other wounds requiring special expertise eg eyelids obtain

and refer for formal exploration in theatre do not inject la into the edges of an infected wound it will not work in that acidic environment and it may spread the infection ga may be the preferred option for treating some wounds in young children inspect wounds for fbs and damage to underlying structures most problems with wound exploration relate to bleeding if it proves difﬁ cult to obtain a good view obtain a good light and an assistant the assistant retracting on a stitch placed on either side of the middle of the wound allows full exposure press on any bleeding point for min then look again lidocaine with adrenaline b p is useful in scalp wounds which are bleeding profusely if bleeding continues consider a tourniquet for up to min consider a sphygmomanometer bp cuff inﬂ ated above

recognized types of wound closure primary closure surgical closure by whatever physical means soon after injury secondary closure no intervention heals by granulation secondary intention delayed primary closure surgical closure days after injury if there is no underlying injury or fb treat fresh wounds by primary closure as soon as possible accurate opposition of wound edges and obliteration

fracturedislocation fracture adjacent to or in combination with a dislocated joint deformity describe deformity using the terms displacement angulation and rotation displacement translation describe the relative position of two bone ends to each other further describe the direction that the distal fragment is displaced from the anatomical position eg volar lateral also estimate the degree of apposition of the bone ends eg angulation this is usually described in terms of the position of the point of the angle eg posterior angulation means that the distal fragment is pointing anteriorly this can sometimes be confusing although a little longwinded one way to avoid confusion is to describe the direction in which the distal part points relative to the anatomical position eg a colles fracture may be described as a fracture of the distal radius in which the distal fragment points dorsally try to measure the angle on xray rotation describe the degree of rotation from the anatomical position in terms of the direction eg external or internal rotation in which the distal part has moved fractures the role of osteoporosis osteoporosis is an important factor in a signiﬁ cant

partial sprains there may be some resultant slight ligamentous laxity but with a deﬁ nite endpoint on stressing third degree sprains reﬂ ect completely torn ligaments causing signiﬁ cant laxity patients sometimes report hearing a snap at the time of injury ligament sprains are very common but there is a lack of reliable evidence about treatment prolonged immobilization seems to be detrimental to recovery due to muscle wasting and loss of proprioception painful minor sprains respond well to traditional measures ice compression with elastic supportstrapping elevation and progressive mobilization as soon as symptoms allow simple analgesics such as paracetamol or nsaid eg ibuprofen may help complete ligament rupture can be relatively painless but if associated with gross joint instability may require surgical repair associated haemarthroses require orthopaedic appraisal aspiration and often initially protection and immobilization in pop strains indirect injury involving muscletendon units may be classiﬁ ed in a similar fashion to ligament sprains pain on palpation over the site of injury is also reproduced by passive stress or active contraction of the affected muscle unit sometimes a palpable defect may be apparent in complete ruptures which typically occur at the musculotendinous junction however asso ciated swelling may prevent any defect from being easily palpable treat minor strains similarly to sprains consider specialist review for complete ruptures some of which may require surgical repair direct muscle injuries these result from

around the ankle most commonly involve the malleoli medial lateral and what is commonly referred to as the posterior malleolus the posterior part of the distal tibia the mortice joint formed by the talus and the distal tibia ﬁ bula ligaments and the distal tibioﬁ bular syndesmosis allows very little rotation or angulation at the ankle joint as a consequence forced twisting or angulation of the ankle joint causes fractures associated with ligamentous injuries and in severe cases disruption of the distal tibioﬁ bular syndesmosis treatment depends upon a combination of clinical ﬁ ndings and xray appearances look carefully for talar shift small avulsion fractures essentially reﬂ ect ligamentjoint capsule damage treat with rest elevation analgesia and early mobilization as for sprains larger avulsion fractures may require initial immobilization in bkpop with crutches and orthopaedic followup undisplaced isolated medial or lateral malleolar fractures are usually stable and do well with conservative measures provide analgesia crutches and immobilize in a wellpadded bkpop cast advise limb elevation and arrange orthopaedic followup note that an isolated high lateral malleolus fracture may only be apparent on the lateral xray and may be associated with deltoid medial ligament injury with instability some require orif displaced fractures of the medial or lateral malleolus

ear diagnosis depends upon direct visualization with the auriscope in children remember that as with fbs elsewhere there may be no history of fb available removal many fbs can be removed under direct vision with hooks manipulate gently to avoid causing damage or further impaction drown live insects in lidocaine ﬁ rst do not try to syringe out vegetable matter with water as this may cause swelling and pain if there is some difﬁ culty eg ball bearing or bead in an uncooperative child refer to ear nose and throat ent department to consider removal under ga removal of beads using an orange stick with a tiny amount of superglue on the end has been described but carries some obvious dangers and requires complete patient cooperation embedded earrings the butterﬂ y piece of an ear ring may become embedded in the posterior part of the ear lobe causing inﬂ ammation or infection the earrings are usually easily removed once adequate analgesia has been established render the ear anaesthetized with a greater auricular nerve block b nerve blocks of forehead and ear p or directly inﬁ ltrate local anaesthetic into the lobe remembering that this is a highly sensitive area the butterﬂ y is released by applying pressure in a posterior direction occasionally forceps and a small posterior skin incision may be required to open up the track if there is evidence of infection prescribe antibiotics eg coamoxiclav and arrange gp followup advise the patient not to wear earrings until the symptoms have settled nasal foreign bodies usually affects children who present with offensive unilateral nasal discharge also occurs in adults with psychotic illness or learning disabilities removal remove easily accessible anterior nasal fbs in ed however there is a risk of aspiration with any nasal fb particularly in uncooperative patients refer such patients to an ent surgeon for removal with airway protection instruct the patient to blow their nose whilst occluding the unaffected nostril if unsuccessful consider attempting removal with a nasal speculum hook and forceps as appropriate a ﬁ ne bore tracheal suction catheter attached to wall suction can also work one technique which has been reported in cooperative children is to ask a parent to blow into the childs mouth parents kiss having ﬁ rst ensured a good seal and also occluded the normal nostril nasal button batteries or magnets b

ent team may decide to see the patient immediately or provided the patient can swallow the following day in which case discuss the need for prophylactic antibiotics a ﬁ sh bone can scratch the pharynx causing sensation of a fb to persist after it has gone oesophageal food bolus obstruction usually involves a lump of meat patients with complete obstruction present unable to swallow solids or liquids including their own saliva there may be retrosternal discomfort refer to the surgical team for endoscopy glucagon mg iv relieves some episodes of food bolus obstruction but endoscopy is still advisable to look for oesophageal stenosis or malignancy wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter ear nose and throat ear examination scope of the examination full ear examination includes assessment of the vestibulocochlear nerve and auroscope examination check for mastoid or pinna tenderness look at the external ear canal for discharge or swelling and examine the tympanic membrane for colour translucency bulging and the cone of light assessing hearing hearing can be assessed by asking the patient to place one ﬁ nger in their ear stand a foot behind the patients unoccluded ear and whisper a two syllable word ask the patient to repeat the word webers and rinnes tests webers test strike a hz tuning fork and place in the centre of the forehead in conductive deafness the sound localizes to the deaf ear with sensorineural deafness the sound localizes to the good ear rinnes test strike a hz tuning fork and place it on the mastoid process ask the patient to tell you when they no longer hear the sound then immediately place in front of the auditory meatus in a normal ear air conduction is heard for twice as long as bone conduction in conductive deafness bone conduction is heard for longer than air conduction in sensorineural deafness air conduction is heard longer than bone conduction nystagmus to complete assessment of the vestibulocochlear nerve examine for nystagmus all forms of nystagmus can be associated with intracranial lesions as well as peripheral causes however downbeat and upbeat nys tagmus in particular signify a central cause tinnitus or deafness tends to suggest a peripheral cause peripheral nystagmus is exacerbated by gazing towards the side of the fast phase alexanders law central nystagmus may change direction depending on the side of gaze

remains very controversial oral antibiotics eg day course of amoxicillin or clarithromycin are of questionable value but are frequently given consider oral antibiotics if no improvement within hr or earlier if there is deterioration or perforation if perforation has occurred often heralded by a sudden i pain arrange ent followup and advise not to swim otherwise arrange gp followup acute mastoiditis this is an uncommon but important diagnosis to make because of the risk of intracranial spread of infection mastoiditis follows an episode of acute otitis media consider it if there is no response to therapy eg dis charging ear for days suspect it if there is pain redness swelling or tenderness over the mastoid process the pinna may be pushed forwards outwards swelling may mean that the drum is not visible refer urgently to the ent surgeon for admission and iv antibiotics wwwketabpezeshkicom earache cholesteatoma this erosive condition affects the middle ear and mastoid a cholest

fracture b p pain is associated with d hearing perforation is visible on examination treatment most heal spontaneously with conservative measures and advice to keep out of water arrange ent followup and give prophylactic oral antibiotics according to local policy note that gentamicin or neomycin eardrops may cause sensorineural deafness because of ototoxicity when the tympanic membrane is ruptured barotrauma sudden changes in atmospheric pressure with a blocked eustachian tube can result in pain and hearing loss this usually affects aircraft passengers and divers especially if they have a cold viral upper respiratory tract infection pain is often relieved by the valsalva manoeuvre breathing out with the mouth closed while pinching the nose decongestant nasal spray may help if the problem does not resolve spontaneously give analgesia nsaid arrange ent followup if the pain persists wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter ear nose and throat epistaxis nasal bleeding may be idiopathic or follow minor trauma eg nose picking when it occurs in patients with hypertension and coagulation disorders haemorrhage can be severe with signiﬁ cant mortality epistaxis may follow isolated nasal fracture and more major facial injury site of bleeding most nasal bleeding is from the anterior nasal septum in or close to littles area a few patients have posterior nasal bleeding which may be brisk equipment direct visualization of the anterior nasal cavity is aided by a headlamp eg batteryoperated head torch ﬁ ne soft suction catheter and nasal speculum wear goggles to avoid blood splashes in the eyes initial approach associated facial injury assess abc especially pulse and bp and resuscitate as necessary treat hypovolaemia vigorously no associated injury check airway patency pulse and bp treat hypovolaemia aggressively check coagulation status of patients on anticoagulants and treat appropriately b p sit the patient up and instruct them to compress the ﬂ eshy part of their nose between ﬁ nger and thumb for min if this stops the bleeding the patient may be discharged after min observation continuing bleeding after pressure adults apply a cotton wool pledget soaked in lidocaine with in adrenaline then with a headlamp and nasal speculum try to identify the bleeding point treat small anterior bleeding points with cautious cautery by applying a silver nitrate stick for sec avoid excessive cautery and never cauterize both sides of the septum this may cause septal necrosis if cautery stops the bleeding observe for min and discharge with gp follow up advise avoidance of snifﬁ ng picking or blowing the nose meantime children applying nasal antiseptic cream eg naseptin is as effective as cautery in stopping bleeding the cream is relatively easy to apply continuing bleeding despite cautery insert a nasal pack a specialized compressed surgical sponge nasal tampon eg merocel or rapid rhino is ideal gently insert a lubricated tampon horizontally and inﬂ ate with a ml syringe of saline alternatively pack the nose in a traditional way with cm wide ribbon gauze soaked in oily paste eg bismuth iodoform parafﬁ n paste once packing has stopped the bleeding refer to ent for admission observation is advisable especially in the elderly the pack may dislodge and obstruct the airway continuing bleeding despite packing refer to the ent surgeon the bleeding site is likely to be posterior and can cause hypovolaemic shock in this situation insert large bore venous cannulae send blood for fbc coagulation screen crossmatching and commence an ivi posterior nasal bleeding usually responds to tamponade with a foley catheter remove the nasal tampon and insert a lubricated uninﬂ ated foley catheter through the bleeding nostril into the nasopharynx inﬂ ate the balloon with air and gently withdraw the catheter thus tamponading the bleeding site secure the catheter to the cheek with tape and then reinsert the anterior nasal tampon wwwketabpezeshkicom nasal fracture nasal fracture the prominent exposed position of the nose combined with the delicacy of its bones render it relatively prone to injury remember that the nose is part of the head so nose injury head injury and potentially cervical spine injury also history the nose is commonly broken by a direct blow eg from a punch or following a fall onto the face nasal fracture is usually accompanied by bleeding search for a history of associated facialhead injury diplopia loss of consciousness etc examination this is a clinical diagnosis based upon a history of injury with nasal swelling and tenderness having made the diagnosis assess whether there is nasal deviation it is useful to ask the patient to look in a mirror check and record whether the patient can breathe through each nostril look for an associated septal haematoma this will appear as a smooth bulging swelling which may obstruct the nasal passage children are at particular risk of septal haematoma which predisposes to secondary infection and septal necrosis assess for additional injuries to the head or face eg tender mandible diplopia tender maxilla injury to the bridge of the nose may result in persistent epistaxis andor cerebrospinal ﬂ uid rhinorrhoea investigation do not xray to diagnose a nasal fracture the diagnosis is a clinical one obtain appropriate xrays eg orthopantomogram opg or facial views if there is clinical suspicion of other bony injuries nasal fractures are often apparent on facial xrays or ct scans treatment resuscitate and treat for associated head injury continuing nasal haemorrhage is uncommon refer to an ent surgeon to consider urgent manipulation under anaesthetic mua to stop the bleeding meanwhile insert a nasal tampon refer urgently to an ent surgeon if there is a septal haematoma this will require incision and drainage in order to prevent septal necrosis clean and close overlying skin wounds steristrips often allow good skin apposition if there is signiﬁ cant contamination of the wound start a course of prophylactic oral antibiotics eg coamoxiclav one tablet po tds for days provide oral analgesia eg ibuprofen mg po tds if the nose is

clinical examination reveals whether facial nerve palsy is of upper motor neurone or lower motor neurone type upper motor neurone paralysis is usually due to a stroke b p resulting in unilateral facial muscle weakness but with sparing of the muscles of the forehead if stroke is the cause there may be additional evidence elsewhere eg hemiparesis affecting the limbs lower motor neurone paralysis of the facial nerve results in weakness of the muscles of one side of the face the facial nerve arises from its nucleus in the pons emerges from the pons to travel past the cerebello pontine angle through the petrous part of the temporal bone to emerge from the stylomastoid foramen and thence into the parotid gland where it divides into branches during its passage through the petrous temporal bone the facial nerve is accompanied by the chorda tympani carrying taste ﬁ bres from the anterior of one half of the tongue and gives off the nerve to stapedius lesions of the facial nerve

the following eds are under pressure to manage large numbers of patients in a timely fashion so it may be difﬁ cult for ed staff to spend large amounts of time with any single patient lack of

anatomically physi ologically emotionally and in the spectrum of pathological conditions to which they are susceptible it is natural for those hospital staff who have not previously dealt with children to be slightly apprehensive about treating them particularly when they are distressed or seriously unwell be guided by more experienced staff who are often adept at dealing with children as patients and very often as parents as well such staff are particularly good at recognizing children who are seriously unwell listen carefully to what they have to say there is no substitute for expe rience but practical courses aimed at managing emergencies in children eg advanced paediatric life support apls are highly recommended these courses deservedly devote much time to the recognition of seriously ill or injured children according to whether or not they are physiologically deranged consider each child according to expected normal physiological values see table children do not always respond in the same way to illness as adults they are particularly likely to be frightened of doctors nurses and hospitals do not waste the opportunity to make important observations respi ratory rate pattern and effort behaviour conscious level colour and parental interaction spend time talking to children to reassure them and win their conﬁ dence before starting any examination or performing any procedure unless of course they require emergency resuscitation lowering yourself to their physical level will make you less intimidating involve the parents from the start see below where appropriate allow children to relax and play with toys play therapists can be particularly helpful providing distraction during procedures dealing with parents parents are patients too they are likely to be understandably upset and worried take time to explain to the parents exactly what is happening to their children at all stages obtain appropriate consent but do not delay lifesaving measures for the sake of both parents and children try to allow parents to remain with their children as much as possible this is especially important during resuscitation where an experienced member of the nursing staff should be allocated to look after and explain to parents what is happening if the presence of the parents is impeding the progress of the resuscitation gently ask them to leave analgesia differences between adults and children do not diminish the need to provide adequate analgesia for children reassurance is often an important component but be honest and do not be tempted to tell to a child that a painful procedure eg emergency insertion of an intravenous iv cannula will not produce any pain or discomfort this will simply cause the child to lose conﬁ dence wwwketabpezeshkicom the

each year many of whom are admitted for observation thankfully relatively few per year die more than of paediatric unintentional ingestions involve drugs and poisons in the home that are plainly visible to the child poisoning is particularly likely to occur at times of stress eg arrival of new baby disturbed parental relationships moving house when there may be d supervision and disruption of the usual routine perhaps partly for this reason children who present with a ﬁ rst episode of poisoning are at i risk of further episodes it is therefore important to advise the parents of ways of preventing poisoning in children see list below ofﬁ cial measures packaging of drugs legislation has been introduced to try to tackle the problem of poisoning in children perhaps the most successful has been the widespread adoption of childresistant drug containers unfortunately it is not yet mandatory for these containers to be used for liquid drugs or potentially dangerous household items such as bleach some drugs are presented in strip packaging in the hope that an impulsive child would lose interest before gaining access to a signiﬁ cant quantity advice for parents consider providing a

presented in childresistant containers dispose of outofdate drugs and those no longer required never refer to drugs as sweets in an attempt to encourage the child to take them take medicines out of

cause of death in children deaths year in the uk table as in adults blunt injury in children is far more common than penetrating injury the number of deaths in children after trauma is dwarfed by the number who sustain serious injuries most serious injuries result from road trafﬁ c collisions and falls of paediatric trauma deaths occur in the prehospital setting most of these children are either dead when found or have sustained overwhelming injuries the greatest potential for reducing trauma deaths clearly lies with injury prevention however there is enormous potential to reduce the number of permanently disabled children by early identiﬁ cation of injuries and expert treatment the best outcome results from involvement of senior and experienced staff at an early stage prompt recognition of the seriously injured child is crucial to this pattern of injuries anatomical and physiological differences mean that the pattern of injuries in children differ considerably from those in adults compared with adults children have smaller physical size a relatively larger head more compliant bones a higher ratio of surface area to body weight epiphyses experience and an awareness of the patterns of paediatric injury will assist resuscitation efforts the smaller size and physical proximity of internal organs frequently results in the dissipated forces causing injuries to multiple structures multiple injuries the compliance of the bony thoracic cage in children allows signiﬁ cant underlying organ injury without rib fractures similarly certain injuries not uncommon in adults eg

prevention injury prevention terminology the term accident implies an unforeseen unintentional event one which occurs by chance the implication is that accidents cannot be prevented however there is considerable evidence to suggest that accidents are far from random events but are relatively predictable and amenable to prevention for this reason medical experts now prefer to avoid use of the terms accidents and accident prevention and refer to injury prevention instead background injuries to children tend to occur more frequently in certain groups and at certain times boys sustain more injuries than girls injuries are associated with social deprivation injuries often occur at times of family stress and change including marital disharmony moving house and holidays prevention theory prevention of injury does not simply refer to physical injuries but poisonings also injuries andor the effects of injuries may be prevented in a number of different ways primary prevention measures stop injuries occurring for example the installation of fences around domestic swimming pools may reduce drowning locked medicine cabinets might prevent inadvertent poisoning secondary prevention measures reduce the extent of harm caused by an injurious event the most obvious examples are helmets seat belts and air bags in the context of road trafﬁ c collisions tertiary prevention includes most forms of ﬁ rst aid and hospital treatment and aims to limit the effect of an injury after it has already happened eg surgery to stop intraabdominal haemorrhage antidotes for certain poisons prevention strategies and the role of ed staff the focus of hospital staff treating injured patients has understandably always been the injuries themselves tertiary prevention in addition to any possible issues of nai ed staff need to consider how future injuries to children might be prevented eg by discussing with parents the beneﬁ ts of bicycle helmets in the context of an individual child it may sometimes be appropriate to contact the gphealth visitor with a view to seeing if interventions might prevent future injuries to a particular child and siblings more general interventions

injuries to adjacent bones and joints is an xray required if in doubt obtain an xray the ease with which childrens bones fracture and the difﬁ culties with history and examination mean that it is sensible to adopt a low threshold for requesting xrays ensure that two views at right angles are taken eg ap and lateral including associated joints interpreting xrays many fractures are subtle and easily missed to minimize the chance of this occurring visually trace around the cortex of each bone looking for any irregularities interpretation of paediatric xrays is complicated by the presence of various ossiﬁ cation centres and accessory ossicles both are commonly mistaken for fractures eg the olecranon epiphysis the os trigonum and bipartite patella ossiﬁ cation centres appear and fuse in a relatively predictable fashion although the rate at which this occurs varies slightly from child to child see table knowledge of this process combined with experience of seeing many paediatric xrays greatly assists interpretation if in doubt about an xray obtain a second opinion there is no justiﬁ cation for xraying the uninjured side to see what normal is as an additional safeguard most eds now

subluxation of the radial head pulled elbow a direct pull on the arm of a child aged years may result in the radial head being pulled out of the annular ligament nursemaids elbow the child then refuses to use the arm if there is a characteristic history there is no need to xray the traditional reduction technique involves ﬂ exing the elbow to then supinating the elbow fully however manipulating the elbow into full pronation may give a better reduction rate www bestbetsorguk a click is sometimes felt or heard during reduction if full pronation fails try full supination and leave for min allow the child to play and watch he will usually use the arm again soon if he does not obtain xrays and senior help repeat manipulation can be done once but if that does not lead to a rapid improvement in function then place the arm in a sling give analgesia and plan to review in days the elbow may reduce spontaneously or may need further manipulation rarely repeated manipulation is unsuccessful until sedation is given after successful manipulation advise the parents to avoid pulling the arm forcefully a pulled elbow may recur up to about age if the arm is pulled but after that

nonambulatory child suggests child abuse swelling is often not dramatic knee injuries knee ligament injuries are rare in children compared with adults suspect a fracture or epiphyseal injury instead this is a reﬂ ection of the relative strengths of ligament and bone in the child so for example an injury which might cause anterior cruciate ligament rupture in the adult will often produce avulsion of its tibial attachment in the child this tibial plateau fracture will produce a haemarthrosis and will be apparent on the lateral xray provide analgesia and refer to the orthopaedic surgeon patella fractures do not confuse a congenitally bipartite patella for a fracture the small bony fragment in a bipartite patella lies superolaterally and has rounded edges patellar sleeve fractures are not uncommon in children and adolescents these osteochondral fractures typically result from high impact jumping activities or sports suspect clinically if there is local pain and tenderness and an inability to actively extend the knee radiographs can be misleading as only a small bony fragment is avulsed usually from the inferior pole but a large part of the articular surface is removed with it

of what deﬁ nes acceptable behaviour and what constitutes child abuse are open to some debate and are certainly affected by historical and cultural factors for example corporal punishment once considered normal and usual is now unacceptable the extremes of child abuse however are easily deﬁ ned types of child abuse physical abuse nai including bruises fractures wounds and burns sexual abuse poisoning suffocation neglect or emotional abuse fabricated and induced illness previously known as munchausen syndrome by proxy prevalence it is impossible to be sure how common child abuse is it is generally agreed that it is much more prevalent than was previously believed of children are brought to the attention of professional agencies for suspected abuse it is believed that of uk children suffer severe physical abuse each year and it has been estimated that child deaths occur each year as a result of abuse by parents or carers aetiology child abuse affects both boys and girls the ﬁ rstborn child is most frequently affected infants and young children are at most risk of serious injury or death partly reﬂ ecting their physical vulnerability the abuser is often a parent or cohabitant of a parent more commonly male and may have suffered abuse themselves as a child sometimes the child may be targeted because they are unwanted eg she should have been a boy whilst the abuser may be a young parent with unrealistic expectations and living in difﬁ cult social circumstances unemployment drug abuse often they do not conform to this standard description child abuse affects all levels of society clear links between domestic violence and physical abuse of children have been identiﬁ ed children whose parents have mental health problems may be more vulnerable to abuse and neglect role of the junior emergency department doctor managing the child and family where there is suspected child abuse is an extremely delicate skill requiring considerable tact and experience the role of the junior doctor is to consider the possibility of child abuse and to involve a senior doctor at an early stage recent nice guidance is avail able at httpwwwniceorguknicemedialivepdf wwwketabpezeshkicom child abuse the suspicious history certain features should alert the doctor to the possibility of child abuse injuries inconsistent with the history given injuries inappropriate for developmental age eg a baby aged months rolled off a bed changing history of injury or vague history lacking vivid details delay in seeking medical attention abnormal parental attitudes eg apparent lack of concern for child frequent ed attendances occasionally children provide an account of abuse wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter paediatric emergencies presentation of child abuse physical child abuse is commonly referred to as nai children may present with a variety of injuries which may occur singly or in combination bruising children naturally sustain bruises during minor incidents as part of growing up bruising over the knees and shins is a normal ﬁ nding in chil dren particularly toddlers who are also prone to sustaining injuries to their foreheads and chins as a result of falls older children frequently sustain bruises over the lateral aspect of their elbows and hips during normal play and sport activities as well as considering the possibility of nai remember that bruising may occur as part of an unusual patho logical disease process eg henochschönlein purpura haemophilia itp leukaemia and other causes of thrombocytopenia a mongolian blue spot is an innocuous congenital ﬁ nding on the lower back of some young chil dren especially noncaucasians which may be confused with bruising the following features should prompt consideration of nai bruising in unusual sites eg medial aspect of upper arms or thighs multiple bruising of different ages very difﬁ cult for the nonexpert to judge at less common sites uncommon injuries bilaterally finger imprinting eg grip complexes around upper limbs or slap marks imprints or marks from other objects eg belt stick human bite marks probably adult if canines cm apart ensure photographs next to a ruler are planned after admission petechiae on the face may reﬂ ect smothering and asphyxiation it has been previously suggested that of sids may have been smothered but remember that petechiae also occur with forceful coughing or vomiting wounds and burns children commonly sustain wounds and burns unintentionally however deliberately inﬂ icted burns are found in a signiﬁ cant proportion of physically abused children the following suggest the possibility of nai torn frenulum of upper lip can also reﬂ ect a normal toddler injury perineal wounds and burns see sexual abuse b p small deep circular burns with raised edges suggest cigarette burns hand lower limb and buttock burns may follow forced immersion in bath water that is too hot these burns tend to be of the stocking and glove type without higher splash burns parts of the buttocks may be spared where skin has been in contact with the bath not the water wwwketabpezeshkicom presentation of child abuse head injuries most head injuries result from unintentional incidents accidents in infants they often result from the parent or carer dropping the child the fractures caused by this tend to be single linear and involve the parietal bone consider nai if the following occur retinal haemorrhages characteristic but not diagnostic of shaking they may also rarely be seen in co poisoning for example in the context of nai retinal haemorrhages are often associated with subdural haematomas occipital skull fracture multiple wide or comminuted fractures subdural haematoma in an infant or toddler natural progression of bruises swelling and tenderness of bruising suggests relatively recent origin but this is not very reliable accurate assessment of the age of bruising according to its colour is not possible except that a yellow bruise is almost certainly hr old oftquoted natural temporal progression of colour changes of bruising allows only a guess at the age of a bruise avoid being drawn on this issue which may have considerable legal implications instead record the ﬁ ndings as accurately as possible describe the colour size and distribution of the bruising usually a child suspected of having suffered physical abuse will also be examined by a relevant expert such as a paediatrician andor police surgeon clinical forensic physician wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter paediatric emergencies presentation of child abuse fractures certain fractures are very common in children pay attention to the history of injury and whether or not it appears to be consistent with the fractures sustained multiple fractures of different ages especially if previously undiagnosed andor not brought to medical attention should arouse suspicion of nai to help assess the approximate age of a bony injury see table

discharge or bleeding behavioural disturbance enuresis encopresis inappropriate sexual behaviour the child may allege sexual abuse sexually transmitted disease including anogenital warts pregnancy accurately record statements made by the child word for word using quotation marks do not pursue a genital examination but involve a senior doctor at an early stage who may wish to examine the genitalia using a colposcope in collaboration with a police surgeon clinical forensic physician in the context of an allegation of recent sexual assault the collection of forensic samples for dna analysis is likely to be required fabricated or induced illness previously known as munchausen syndrome by proxy a parentcarer may invent a history of illness in a child and fabricate physical signs to substantiate it the history often involves one or more of the following apnoeic episodes ﬁ ts bowel disturbances rashes allergies or fevers classically the deceiver is the mother the child may be made ill by administering drugs or poisons if suspected do not confront the deceiver but take blood and urine samples for a toxicology screen and refer to the paediatric team bear in mind that some parents may be naturally very anxious and may exaggerate symptoms rather than deliberately fabricate them wwwketabpezeshkicom chapter paediatric emergencies management of child abuse role of the junior emergency department doctor the junior ed doctor needs to be vigilant in considering abuse when initially assessing and treating children any suspicion of child abuse should prompt involvement of an expert senior doctor paediatrician or ed consultant in every hospital system there will be a designated doctor for child protection who should be available for advice he or she will examine the child and arrange hospital admission for further investigations eg skeletal survey as necessary social services and the police may need to be involved the child may require examination by a police surgeon clinical forensic physician and samplesphotographs obtained follow local procedures the chief consideration is the treatment and protection of the child so do not delay treatment of painful or apparently lifethreatening problems whilst awaiting an expert ensure that all documentation is legible and meticulous remember that if child abuse is considered likely siblings may also be at risk uk law the children act this act replaced previous statutes central to the act is the concept that the welfare of the child is paramount in the short term the children act may be used to obtain orders to protect children a variety of orders may be obtained police protection order a police ofﬁ cer has legal powers to take any child into police protection for up to hr if deemed necessary for hisher own protection this order may be used to prevent a child being taken away from the ed by a parent or guardian against medical advice emergency protection order this has replaced the place of safety order a court order valid for up to days may be obtained if the child is believed to be at signiﬁ cant risk of harm such an order would normally be requested by a social worker child assessment order this court order may be obtained in order to allow an assessment to be performed of a child who appears to be at risk of injury care order this transfers the care of a child from the parents to the local authority social services department if a care order is in force matters requiring parental consent should be referred to the social worker not the foster carer residence order this court order deﬁ nes where a child should live and who has parental responsibility wwwketabpezeshkicom management of child abuse child protection plan replaces the child protection register this register is kept by the social services it contains a list of names of those children considered to be at current risk of harm ed staff should be aware of how to access child protection register information previous hospital case notes are also very useful in this respect when searching for previous records remember that many children may be known by several surnames child protection conferences a conference may be called by social services if it is suspected that a child has been abused child protection conferences should be held promptly and aim to deﬁ ne a protection plan for the future protection of the child and family unlike the criminal courts where the onus is on the prosecution to prove abuse beyond reasonable doubt child protection conferences will determine whether a child is deemed to be at risk of signiﬁ cant harm and whether a protection plan is required case conferences consist of a number of individuals including chairman usually a senior member of the social services department hospital consultant gp social worker police health visitor teacher education welfare ofﬁ cer child abuse advisor local authority solicitor parents are always invited and older children may also attend
